Changes since 2.0.0
===================

This is a placeholder for changes since the official *2.0.0* release. Please
add notes here for changes and fixes as they are released into the master branch.

-   The SOAP implementation has changed. As part of that change, the ex-libris Rosetta SDK dependency has moved from
    `2.2.0` to `5.5.0`. This means that the `dps-sdk-5.5.0.jar` must be installed in a local Maven repository for the
    maven build to work. Install this jar by running the following command from the root of the project::

        (for Windows):
        call mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.exlibris -DartifactId=dps-sdk -Dversion=5.5.0 \
            -Dpackaging=jar  -DpomFile=wct-store\etc\lib\dps-sdk-5.5.0-pom.xml \
            -Dfile=wct-store\etc\lib\dps-sdk-5.5.0.jar

        (for *nix):
        mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.exlibris -DartifactId=dps-sdk -Dversion=5.5.0 \
            -Dpackaging=jar -DpomFile=wct-store/etc/lib/dps-sdk-5.5.0-pom.xml \
            -Dfile=wct-store/etc/lib/dps-sdk-5.5.0.jar



2.0.0
=====

Released December 2018, this version builds on release 1.7.0, which was a proof-of-concept integrating
Heritrix 3 with WCT. Version 2.0.0 completes that integration.

What's new
-----------

Heritrix 3 profile management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   The configuration options available for Heritrix 3 are different from the
    old Heritrix 1 profiles, but management of them stays the same.

-   Heritrix 3 profile options are contained within a single simplified 'scope' tab. This
    relies on a correctly formatted set of fields within the background profile xml. Due
    to this, imported Heritrix 3 profiles cannot be edited through the same screen, and are
    only editable via an in-screen xml editor.

-   Validation of Heritrix 3 profiles is achieved using an available H3 Harvest Agent. The
    profile is used to build a special one-off job within the agent, which in essence validates
    the integrity of the Heritrix 3 profile. The job is then destroyed and any unsuccessful
    outcome is fed back to the WCT user interface.

Targets
~~~~~~~~

-   Heritrix 3 Targets can now be scheduled, and will be assigned to an available H3 Harvest
    Agent when due to run.

-   *Running* Heritrix 3 Target Instances have an H3 script console available to use. This
    console can be used to run scripts against the Target Instance job in Heritrix 3,
    similar to the scripting console available in H3's own UI.

Heritrix 1
~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Heritrix 1 integration has been preserved for now, allowing for Targets to transition
    to using Heritrix 3. A period of experimentation is expected when replacing the old
    Heritrix 1 profiles.

Database installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   The sql scripts for setting up the WCT database have been consolidated and brought up to date.
    The folder structure has been refactored and legacy scripts separated to reduce confusion. Any
    script changes have been reflected in the documentation.

-   An additional parent script has been added to simplify the setup process, enabling the setup to be
    completed through running a single script.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   The documentation has been migrated from PDF to the reStructedText format, and now hosted on the
    readthedocs.io platform. This increases the accessibility of the documentation and makes it simpler
    to maintain and update.

-   All documentation has been brought up-to-date to reflect v2.0.0 changes.


Developer
----------

-   The old Harvest Agent module has been separated into a Heritrix 1 and Heritrix 3 version. This has
    been done with a view to using the core Harvest Agent component to interface with other crawlers
    in the future.

-   Usage of the old heritrix-1.14 dependency, *aheritrix-1.14.1.jar*, has been upgraded where possible
    to use the webarchive-commons library.


Things to be aware of
----------------------

-   The Bandwidth restriction functionality is not currently applicable to the new Heritrix 3 crawling.
    The Bandwidth feature has been underused in recent years and was not compatible out-of-the-box with
    Heritrix 3. A decision on whether to develop the feature to be compatible or remove it entirely will
    be made in the future.

-   The existing prune and import functionality within the QA tool is not currently compatible with
    Target Instances harvested using Heritrix 3. These components of QA functionality are no longer
    fit-for-purpose in version 2.0.0, and will be re-developed as part of the WCT development road-map.

-   The Groups feature is not currently compatible with Heritrix 3 profiles. This is intended to be resolved
    in the near future with a minor release.



1.6.2
=====

This is the *WCT 1.6.2 GA* version.

Obtaining the source files
--------------------------

The WCT code is now stored in a GIT repository on sourceforge - available from
the *code* link on the main WCT sourceforge project page.

The previous versions of WCT are available via the *Legacy Code* link, if
needed. This is still a CVS repository.

Before installing
-----------------

Please ensure the user that WCT uses to login to your database has the correct
permissions to create temporary tables. Failure to grant this will result in
problems during the purge process.

WCT new features and changes for v1.6.2
---------------------------------------

UI new features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import https urls
    The import functionality on the Tree View screen for a harvest, now allows
    https URLs. Previously the javascript validation on the page only allowed
    http URLs.

Configurable Rosetta access rights
    The Rosetta access codes that are used in the Submit-to-Rosetta module are
    now configurable via the `wct-das.properties` file in the wct-store app.
    These codes are used in the mets.xml when a harvest is archived to Rosetta.

    OMS Codes (Rosetta)
    ::

        dpsArchive.dnx_open_access=xxxx
        dpsArchive.dnx_published_restricted=xxxx
        dpsArchive.dnx_unpublished_restricted_location=xxxx
        dpsArchive.dnx_unpublished_restricted_person=xxxx

Submit-to-Rosetta compatibility with newer Rosetta versions
    Later versions of Rosetta system complained when performing xsd validation
    on the mets.xml file submitted by WCT when archiving a harvest. The
    structure map schema used by WCT was old. As Rosetta auto generates
    structure maps for deposits that are missing them, structure map generation
    was removed from the WCT process.

    Allowing the version of Rosetta you are archiving to to generate the
    appropriate structure map.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Quality Review tool uses original seed url
    The harvest quality review tools were not available previously if the
    original target seed URL was modified.

    Now the target seed URL can be changed, and the QR tool will always look for
    the original URL of the Target Instance instead.

Pruning and importing for warc files fixed
    Pruning and importing on warcs in the Tree View screen was encountering a
    bug. When parsing a warc, the input stream was over-reading the number of
    bytes in the warc-info header, causing unexpected characters to be read when
    trying to access the next record. This was mainly visible when trying to
    import and prune.

Indexing breaking for compressed warcs
    Harvesting as compressed warc was breaking the indexing of a harvest. The
    Heritrix class handling the reading of the compressed warc was missing the
    functionality to move to the next record. The Heritrix library included has
    been recompiled to include a fix.

Duplicate schedules when saving annotations
    When creating/editing a Target - if a schedule is created/edited without
    saving the Target, and then the Target is   saved whilst adding an
    annotation, WCT creates target instances for that schedule but the Target
    remains in a state where it contains a cache of new a schedule(s). So if the
    Target is then saved via the bottom save button, another group of target
    instances will be generated for the new schedule(s).

    This bug has now been fixed. If a schedule already has target instances
    generated (at Annotations tab), then WCT will flag this to prevent any
    duplicates from being generated.

No `strippedcrawl.log` generated on non-windows os
    WCT was hard-coded to use a Windows file path separator when saving this
    log file. Now system specific file path separator is used.

Development related
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Git stripping carriage returns
    Only affected JUnit tests for Submit-to-Rosetta module. The tests read in an
    arc file which originally contained a mix of lines ending in carriage
    returns + line feeds and line feeds. Once the project was moved to git, the
    carriage returns were stripped out, invalidating the character offset values
    in the arc file. The arc file is now stored in the test class as a string,
    in order to preserve all formatting.

Build process special characters
    All non-utf8 characters have been converted to utf8, and project POM files
    changed to build as utf8.

Code repository moved to Github
    Code repository moved to Github, along with all old content that possible to
    take from Sourceforge.


1.6.1
=====

UI new features and improvements
--------------------------------

Date pickers for date fields
    All date fields in WCT now have associated date pickers to aid in selection.

Edit button for view screens
    All possible view screens now have buttons to enable edit mode where the
    user has authority to edit the associated record.

Harvest optimization incl. global option
    There is now the option to specify harvest *optimization* on any target.
    This allows the harvesters to perform harvesting of the associated target
    instances earlier than the schedule otherwise permits. The window for this
    look-ahead is configurable, and defaults to 12 hours.

    This feature can also be disabled on a global basis, temporarily, from the
    `Management->Harvester Configuration->General` screen. Upon restart this
    setting is enabled.

Harvester queue pause
    The queue for harvesters can now be paused on a per-harvester basis. This
    pause only affects harvests which have not yet started - it is still
    possible to pause harvests using the traditional mechanism. To
    activate/deactivate this feature, click the pause/play icon in the
    *Accept tasks* column on the `Management->Harvester Configuration->General`
    screen.

    The intent of this is to be able to pause a specific harvester in order to
    stop it and perform maintenance once harvests are finished.

Scheduling heat map
    A heat map is now available on the target scheduling screen. This allows a
    user to see a rough overview of when jobs are scheduled in the next few
    months or so, in order to choose a day where harvesting is least intensive.

    To view the heat map, visit the `Target->Schedule->edit/new schedule` page.
    Click the calendar icon labelled *heat map* - the days will be colored based
    on how many harvests are scheduled on those days.

    The color of the heat map, and the thresholds used to display the colors,
    are configurable on the  `Management->Harvester Configuration->Bandwidth`
    page. This allows organizations of any size to customize the heat map to the
    capabilities of their harveters.

Import profile to any agency
    The profile import page now has the ability to select any agency to import
    a profile into. This option is only available when the logged in user has
    the authority to manager the profiles for all agencies. When this authority
    is not present, that user's agency is used for the import.

Ability to delete all intray tasks
    There is now a button to allow the deletion of all intray tasks, intended
    mainly for organizations that do not make use of the tasks.

Ability to hide intray tasks
    Similar to the ability to delete all tasks, the tasks can also be hidden
    from view on a per-agency basis. The configuration for this feature is on
    the edit agency page.

Target URL edit
    It is now possible to edit Target URLs once they have been created. Note that
    this will affect all existing and future scheduled target instances!

Target description search
    It is now possible to search inside the description of targets on the target
    listing screen.

Reply-to email address in permissions
    There is now a configurable *reply-to* email address on the permission
    template edit screen. This will show in most modern email clients as
    *Reply-to:* and should be used as the default reply to address in clients
    which support it.

Annotations prompt to save
    When clicking the *add* button for annotations, a prompt now asks whether
    the user wants to save the associated target, target instance, or group.

Indicator flag color picker improvement
    The indicator flag color picker now updates when colors are selected, rather
    than having to click the color wheel icon in the bottom right.

Completed harvests can be *harvested now* where user has authority, state is reset to *Approved*
    Where a user has authority to reinstate and approve a target, they do not
    need to manually change the state to *approved* when adding a new schedule
    or using *harvest now*.

Completed harvests can have schedules added where user has authority, state is reset to *Approved*
    Where a user has authority to reinstate and approve a target, they do not
    need to manually change the state to *approved* when adding a new schedule
    or using *harvest now*.

Groups with sub-groups can now be styled using CSS
    The text for groups with sub-groups in the group listing screen can now be
    styled using CSS.

Rejection reason is shown against rejected harvest results
    The rejection reason was not visible in any UI element for a rejected
    harvest result.  This has been added to the harvest result listing screen.

Bug fixes
---------

Non-english character support for all WCT screens (providing database is configured correctly)
    When the database is configured to support UTF-8 characters, the user
    interface now supports non-english characters on all screens, including
    permissions emails.

    If you are experiencing problems with UTF-8 characters after this release,
    ensure that the database tables explicitly support UTF-8.

Non-existant scheduling alert
    When attempting to create a Target schedule which falls on non-existant
    dates, an alert will be displayed. This is show for custom schedules as
    well as any schedule with a frequency of monthly or less.

    For example, a monthly schedule on the 30th day of the month will not fire
    in February, and a monthly schedule on the 31st day of the month will only
    fire seven months a year, as February, April etc have less than 31 days.

Profile null pointers fixed
    Null pointer exceptions caused by the absence of a default profile have been
    fixed. This was especially a problem when users were creating targets using
    the *bootstrap* user, and was generally experienced by new users of WCT.

Various other null pointers fixed
    A variety of other `NullPointerException` errors have been fixed.

Permissions orphan records
    The database was amended so that permissions records were not duplicated
    then orphaned when any change to permissions was made. In organizations
    where a lot of permissions changes were made, this could result in a large
    number of orphaned records.

Indicator flags can now only be applied to targets for the same agency
    Previously if a user had the "manage flags" authority they could assign any
    indicator flag to any target instance. This can result in users without that
    privilege from being able to find those target instances during a TI search
    by indicator flag.

    Updated Target Instance edit screen to only allow indicator flags for the
    same agency as the owner of the target.

Viewing other TIs in harvest history changes the TI being reviewed
    When reviewing a target instance, clicking on any other target instance in
    the harvest history screen caused a change in the target instance originally
    being reviewed. In some cases users were endorsing the wrong target instance,
    believing that they were still reviewing the one they originally chose to
    review.

    The target instance being reviewed now does not change unless the user
    decides to review the one selected in the target history, and a warning is
    displayed indicating this fact.

Target instances are now completely created for targets with repeating schedules
    A bug was introduced in WCT 1.6 that meant target instances were not created
    when adding a schedule to a target and saving. Any subsequent saves would
    create one target instance, but it could result in missing target instances.
    This has been fixed.

Max width of target, QA indicator screens has been limited to prevent scroll bars
    When using particularly long seeds or target names, a scroll bar on the
    target listing screen was necessary, similarly for the QA indicator listing.
    The table contents are now wrapped and sized appropriately.

The eSerial *next* function (used by NLNZ) has been included on the QA Target Instance Summary page
    Previously, the archive button would not show the *custom deposit form* for
    Rosetta.  A *next* button now allows this function as per the Harvest Result
    screen.

Deletion of harvest resources fixed (requires that WCT database can create temporary tables)
    A potential problem with the deletion of harvest resources was fixed - a
    null pointer exception was possible, which meant that only one harvest was
    deleted per execution of the purge process. Additionally, the WCT database
    user needs authority to create temporary tables (e.g. for Oracle
    `GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE to usr_wct`)

Development related
-------------------

Jetty/H2 database standalone development environment
    It is no longer necessary to install tomcat, a database etc to get a basic
    WCT environment set up and running.

    See the *Developer Guide* for details.

Database upgrade script fixes
    Problems encountered by various users in the database upgrade scripts have
    been corrected. Upgrade scripts for 1.6.1 have been explicitly tested in
    all three databases.

Sourceforge tickets cleaned up and up-to-date
    Some sourceforge tickets had been fixed in the code, but not yet updated.
    Others were no longer necessary, or not possible to change as are not part
    of WCT. These have been investigated and resolved where applicable.
