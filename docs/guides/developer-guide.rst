Basic architecture
==================

The following diagram illustrates the basic architecture and its components.

|diagramWebCuratorToolArchitecturalConnections|

Some important notes
--------------------

-   The Harvest Agents and the Store talk to the Web Curator Tool WebApp, but
    the WebApp does not talk to the Harvest Agents or Store. This means that
    Harvest Agents can come and go.

-   The Harvest Agents and Store signal to the WebApp that they exist by sending
    heartbeat messages.

-   The Heritrix H1 agent/crawler contains its Heritrix1 crawler.

-   The Heritrix H3 crawlers are not aware of their agents. Instead the
    Heritrix H3 agent tracks the Heritrix3 crawler. Each Heritrix H3 agent runs
    as a web application (war). Each Heritrix3 crawler (jar) runs in own JVM.

-   The WebCurator Store runs as a web application (war).

-   The Web Curator Tool WebApp is the only component that communicates with the
    SQL database.


Building
========

Requirements
------------

Build requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Building the Web Curator Tool from source requires the following:

-   Java 8 (1.8) JDK or above (64bit recommended). Current development assumes
    using the Oracle JDK, but long-term it may be better to switch to OpenJDK.

-   Maven 3+ or later.

-   Git (required to clone the project source from Github).

As the artifact targets are Java-based, it should be possible to build the
artifacts on either Linux, Solaris or Windows targets.

Development platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following platforms have been used during the development of the Web
Curator Tool:

-  Sun Solaris 10

-  Red Hat Linux EL3.

-  Ubuntu GNU/Linux 16.04 LTS and later

-  Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 2000, Windows XP Pro, Windows Server 2003

Web Application Server platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Web Curator Tool currently requires that its `.war` components run in a
Web Application Server.

Development has used Tomcat (currently version 8.x) Web Application Server for
development. Testing has also taken place using jetty.

Database platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Web Curator Tool requires a backend database for persistent storage.

Development and testing has taken place using MySQL, Postgres and Oracle. See
the `system-admin-guide`_ for more details. Testing has also used the *H2*
database.

Build commands
--------------

Installing maven dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While maven generally will pull in dependencies as required from Maven Central,
some of the dependencies that different Web Curator Tool components require do
not exist in Maven Central. These dependencies have been checked into the
codebase and must be installed in the local maven repository so they are
available to maven when it builds the different components.

Install the maven dependencies by running from the root project folder:
    For Windows operating system::

        install_maven_dependendencies.bat

    For \*nix-based operating systems::

        install_maven_dependencies.sh


Building with unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This can be run from the root project folder, or from a specific subproject
folder, such as `wct-core`, `harvest-agent-h1`, `harvest-agent-h3` or
`wct-core`.
::

    mvn clean install -P<database-type>

The `-P<database-type>` parameter is one of `mysql`, `oracle`, `postgres`, as
applicable. The `-Ph2` option, if used, is only intended for use with Jetty,
and cannot be used to create the .war file with the current version of Hibernate.

The digital asset store (`wct-store`) and harvest agents (`h1-harvest-agent` and
`h3-harvest-agent`) do not need a database, so there is no need to specify
anything database-related when building or running those specific components.

The artifacts produced by the build (in general these will be `.jar` and `.war`
files) will be found in the `target` subfolders of each subproject. The `.war`
files are generally copied to the Tomcat `webapps` folder for deployment.

Building and skipping unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This can be run from the root project folder, or from a specific subproject
folder, such as `wct-core`, `harvest-agent-h1`, `harvest-agent-h3` or
`wct-core`.::

    mvn clean install -P<database-type> -DskipTests=true

Running with jetty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jetty is an inbuilt lightweight web application server than eliminates the need
to run an Web Curator Tool component under Tomcat. It is not production capable
but is useful for development. `wct-core`, `harvest-agent-h1`, `harvest-agent-h3`
and `wct-store` can all be run using Jetty.

*Note that for `wct-harvest-agent` and `wct-store`, you will see a warning that a
profile couldn't be activated. This is not important.*

To run the component under jetty use the following command::

    mvn jetty:run <command-line-parameters> -P<database-type>

Note that the command line parameters will vary based on the different
components. If the command line parameter is not specified, a default is used.

For these examples, `core-host` is `localhost`, `core-port` is `8080`,
`h1-agent-port` is `8081`, `h3-agent-port` is `8086` and `das-port` is `8082`
but any valid port can be used.

`wct-core` under Jetty and H2 **first time**
    `wct-core` can run with a H2 database (as specified with the `Ph2` parameter,
    which removes the need to run against MySQL, Postgres or Oracle. The first
    time this is run, the `-Dhbm2ddl.auto=create` creates a new instance of this
    database.
    ::

        mvn jetty:run -Ph2 -Dhbm2ddl.auto=create \
            -Dcore.host="<core-host>" -Dcore.port="<core-port>" -Ddas.port="<das-port>" \
            -Darc.store.dir="<arc-store-directory>" \
            -DarchiveType=fileArchive \
            -Dfile.archive.repository="<file-archive-repository>" \
            -Dfile.archive.files="<file-archive-files>" \
            -Dlog4j.log.dir="<log4j-log-dir>" \
            -Dattach.dir="<attachments-directory>"

    In this scenario the bootstrap user will be created. Note that the tables
    are cleared using this command.

`wct-core` under Jetty and H2 **subsequent times** (when the h2 database already exists)
    ::

        mvn jetty:run -Ph2 \
            -Dcore.host="<core-host>" -Dcore.port="<core-port>" -Ddas.port="<das-port>" \
            -Darc.store.dir="<arc-store-directory>" \
            -DarchiveType=fileArchive \
            -Dfile.archive.repository="<file-archive-repository>" \
            -Dfile.archive.files="<file-archive-files>" \
            -Dlog4j.log.dir="<log4j-log-dir>" \
            -Dattach.dir="<attachments-directory>"

`wct-core` under Jetty and oracle
    If using the Oracle database profile, the Oracle driver is required to run
    Jetty. This driver is not availabe via Maven repositories for licensing
    reasons - it needs to be downloaded and manually installed.

    In general the steps are:

    1.  Obtain the appropriate driver for your installation (see Oracle documentation).

    2.  Install it into your maven repository. This is generally done by using
        a command like::

            mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc14 -Dversion=<version> -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<jar-location>

    3.  Change the relevant `pom.xml` to reflect the Oracle jar version in use.

    4.  Add a dependency in the pom.xml for the jetty plugin (refer to the mysql
        profile as a reference).

    More detailed instructions can be found via internet search engines.

    Note also that if you are installing a new database, you will need to create
    a tablespace called `WCT_DATA` in order for database creation scripts to
    function as expected.  Since this is a database specific configuration, it
    cannot be defaulted easily.
    ::

        mvn jetty:run \
            -Dcore.host="<core-host>" -Dcore.port="<core-port>" -Ddas.port="<das-port>" \
            -Darc.store.dir="<arc-store-directory>" \
            -DarchiveType=fileArchive \
            -Dfile.archive.repository="<file-archive-repository>" \
            -Dfile.archive.files="<file-archive-files>" \
            -Dlog4j.log.dir="<log4j-log-dir>" \
            -Dattach.dir="<attachments-directory>"

`harvest-agent-h1` under Jetty
    ::

        mvn jetty:run \
            -Dcore.host="<core-host>" -Dcore.port="<core-port" \
            -Dagent.port="<h1-agent-port>" \
            -Ddas.host="<das-host>" -Ddas.port="<das-port>" \
            -Dharvest.tmp.dir="<harvest-temp-directory>" \
            -Dlog4j.log.dir="<log4j-directory>" \
            -Dattach.dir="<attachments-directory>"

`harvest-agent-h3` under Jetty
    `harvest-agent-h3` requires a separate instance of Heritrix3 to run. See the
    `system-admin-guide`_ for details on how to setup and run Heritrix3.

    There may be conflicts with the JMX port of other components. You can change
    the port used by editing the `build/jetty/jetty-jmx.xml` and changing the
    port from `localhost:9004` to another unused port.

    ::

        mvn jetty:run \
            -Dcore.host="<core-host>" -Dcore.port="<core-port" \
            -Dagent.port="<h3-agent-port>" \
            -Ddas.host="<das-host>" -Ddas.port="<das-port>" \
            -Dharvest.tmp.dir="<harvest-temp-directory>" \
            -Dlog4j.log.dir="<log4j-directory>" \
            -Dattach.dir="<attachments-directory>"

`wct-store` under Jetty
    ::

        mvn jetty:run \
            -Dcore.host="<core-host>" -Dcore.port="<core-port>" -Ddas.port="<das-port>" \
            -Darc.store.dir="<arc-store-directory>" \
            -DarchiveType=fileArchive \
            -Dfile.archive.repository="<file-archive-repository>" \
            -Dfile.archive.files="<file-archive-files>" \
            -Dlog4j.log.dir="<log4j-log-directory>" \
            -Dattach.dir="<attachments-directory>"

XDoclet
~~~~~~~
XDoclet is still used to generate `hibernate.cfg.xml` and the `.hbm.xml` files.
This is configured via the `xdoclet-maven-plugin` and the antrun plugin.

Future development that includes a Hibernate upgrade will remove the dependency
on XDoclet.

Configuration
=============

Configuration details
---------------------

The `system-admin-guide`_ contains detailed information about configuring the
Web Curator Tool.

The configuration files are generally found in the `build` subfolder of each
subproject.

You may need to change various configuration settings in one of these files to
make them work for your specific environment. The MySQL configuration should
require minimal/no changes if using the default installations. The H2
configuration should require no changes to start.

Maven filtering
---------------

Maven has a feature called *filtering* where it tries to replace placeholders
like `${core.port}` with a property value that has been configured. This is an
optional feature which is off by default, however WCT makes use of it for some
of the build resources. Any `<resource>` with a `<filtering>` value of `true`
is filtered, and the properties are supplied in two places: the `<properties>`
tag, and via the `properties-maven-plugin`. These properties are also used to
resolve these placeholders inside the `pom.xml` itself, e.g.
`${databaseType}`.


Developer Guidelines
====================

Coding practice
---------------

-   We assume common good coding practices. Consider following the principles
    outlined in Robert C. Martin's book *Clean Code*
    (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/ ).

-   New functionality changes have a reasonable set of unit tests included.
    This can be enforced through minimal code coverage tests as part of the
    build process.

-   Code contains robust instrumentation, which means extensive and detailed
    logging about the state of operations at significant processing points.

Code style
----------

While coding style can be idiosyncratic and personal, consider following
established coding styles enforced through Checkstyle. This ensures that all
code has a similar look and feel while also preventing wasted effort in code
reviews and pull requests discussing formatting. Candidates for a consistent
coding style include:

-   Google Java Style Guide - https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
    which is a subset of the Google style guide https://github.com/google/styleguide

-   OpenJDK Java Style Guide - http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~alundblad/styleguide/index-v6.html

-   Spring framework code style - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Code-Style

-   47deg coding guide - https://github.com/47deg/coding-guidelines/tree/master/java/spring

-   Oracle's coding conventions - https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf
    Note that this guide is significantly out of date and is only included here
    for historical purposes.

Definition of Done
------------------

Code is considered done and can be merged into the master branch when the
following conditions have been met:

-   The requirements driving the change have been satisfied by the change.

-   The code builds without errors.

-   All unit tests pass.

-   Unit test code coverage remains the same or is increasing.

-   Functional tests have all passed.

-   Non functional requirements met.

-   Significant user journeys all work.

-   Code and other changes have been peer reviewed and approved.

-   New code has instrumentation (logging points) that conveys accurate and
    helpful information about the state of the application.

-   The documentation has been updated to reflect changes in functionality. This
    includes the *Release Notes* `release-notes.rst`, especially for new
    features. If there are any database changes, update the *Data Dictionary*
    `data-dictionary.rst`.

-   The Product Owner accepts the changes.

Semantic versioning
-------------------

Use semantic versioning as described in https://semver.org/ . This means having
a version number composed of major, minor and patch versions. For current
development this means changing the maven `pom.xml` associated with each build
artifact and tagging the associated git commit with the version.

TODO Make the steps to change version number is maven and git more explicit,
perhaps as part of the **Git workflow**.


Git Workflow
============

This workflow is a hybrid of several popular git workflows (Github Flow,
Atlassian Simple Git, Cactus Model, Stable Mainline Model), designed to fit the
needs of the NLNZ and KB collaborative development of WCT. It will use a shared
repository model via Github using the https://github.com/DIA-NZ/webcurator
repository.

Commit Messages
---------------

Prefix commit messages with a ticket number (when applicable). This information
comes in handy when reviewing git history, or when cherry-picking individual
commits (e.g. when cherry-picking a bug-fix commit from master into a release
branch, the resulting history will be more informative).

TODO Consider more detail in the commit message, limiting line length.

Commit message example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    D1.1: Add a unit test for dynamic reflow

Master Branch
-------------

The master branch is the default development branch for this project. For most
purposes, the master branch is considered stable. In other words, if you check
out the master branch you can expect that:

-   It builds on all supported platforms/targets.

-   All unit tests pass (as well as static tests, linter checks and the like).

-   A “standard run” of the software works (WCT should start up).

However, the master branch might not pass a comprehensive QA test at all times.

Feature Development
-------------------

Feature branch purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All development is done in dedicated (relatively short lived) feature branches.
This is where most of the action takes place, including:

-   Feature development.

-   Code review.

-   Integration testing.

A feature branch branches off from master, and once development is finished and
all the integration criteria have been met, code review completed, it is merged
back to the master branch using a pull request.

|diagramFeaturesGoingIntoMasterBranch|

Feature branch naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project will use the following convention for naming feature branches:
::

    “feature/<ticket>_description_separated_by_underscores”

where ticket is a reference to the corresponding ticket in the project issue
tracker (or work plan), and description is a very short description (up to five
words or so) of the purpose of the branch.

Feature branch naming example:
::

    feature/D1.1_new_harvestagent_h3_impl

If a feature branch is running for an extended period of time, consider breaking
the issue/story into smaller components that can be integrated more frequently
with the master branch.

Updating Feature Branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To keep feature branches up to date with changes in the master branch, it is a
good idea to merge regularly from master to minimize merge conflicts later on
when it is time for a feature to be merged back into master.

While rebasing is considered common practice in keeping feature branches up to
date, in most situations it won’t be appropriate in this project due to sharing
remote branches for pull requests and code review/testing. Rebasing rewrites the
history of a branch and has potential for history breakage when sharing branches.

There are some distinct advantages for rebasing, but it's not recommended given
the current nature of a large codebase in a single repository. When the
codebase gets split into multiple repositories based on functional components
the use of rebasing might be more appropriate.

To update feature branches use merging.

Checking out a branch example:
::

    git checkout feature_branch
    git pull origin master

Reasons for using ‘Always Merge’ convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Pull Requests won’t contain rebased commits from master that have already
    been reviewed. You will just see the changes relating to the feature branch.

-   Merging changes from master, ‘rework’ commits, should mean you will only
    need to fix merge conflicts once. Whereas merge conflicts need to be
    resolved every time a rebase is done.

-   Rebasing can be dangerous when used on shared remote branches, as the
    history of the branch is being rewritten.

-   No need to worry about using force push for a branch that has been rebased.

-   Rebasing is generally considered a complex and advanced feature of git. In
    order to make it easier for the community to engage with Web Curator Tool
    developement, it would be wise to keep the project workflow as simple as
    possible.

Code Review and Pull Requests
-----------------------------

Pull Requests are to be used to initiate code reviews and discussions about the
code implementation in a dedicated branch that does not interfere with the main
development branch. This review/testing can done at any stage in the development
of that branch. As a rule, all feature branches must be peer reviewed via Github
before being merged into the master branch.

Sharing a feature branch remotely
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Ensure your feature branch is up to date with latest changes from master.

2.  Push the latest commit from your feature branch to the shared github
    repository.

3.  Fetch remote feature branch into local repository.

Initiating a code review via Github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Ensure your feature branch is up to date with latest changes from master.

2.  Push the latest commit from your feature branch to the shared github
    repository.

3.  Navigate to that branch in Github, and open a Pull Request.

4.  Use WIP if not ready to be merged into master.

5.  Use assigning and mentions to ensure the right people are notified of the
    Pull Request.

After the initial push of a feature branch you can keep pushing updates to the
remote branch multiple times throughout. This can happen in response to
feedback, or because you’re not done with the development of the feature.

Merging into Master
-------------------

Merging feature branches into master will use the no fast forward method. This
forces the creation of merge commits to preserve the notion of the feature
branches in the git history, and also makes it easier to revert a merge if
necessary.

TODO Shouldn't all merges to Master be done via Github pull request? In fact,
the Github master branch should be locked down so that merges are done ONLY by
pull request.

::
    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff branch

Example of merging with fast forward:
::

    git merge --no-ff feature/DX.Y_desc

If merging a major feature that includes a large number of commits then add the
`--log` flag to the merge command to include a brief description of the commits
that were merged.

Example of merging with log flag:
::

    git merge --no-ff --log feature/DX.Y_desc

Releases
--------

Release branch criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project will use release branches and tags to designate releases. Once it
has been decided what version number to use and what commit to base a release
on, a new release branch is created from the selected commit, and it is never
merged back into master.

|diagramMasterAndFeatureBranches|

Changes to the release branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a release branch is announced, only serious bug fixes are included in the
release branch. If possible these bug fixes are first merged into master and
then cherry-picked into the release branch. This way you can't forget to
cherry-pick them into master and encounter the same bug on subsequent releases.

Release branch naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a regular major.minor.patch version numbering scheme (e.g. semantic
versioning), a release branch should be named `release/vX.Y`, where `X` is the
major version number and `Y` is the minor version number.

Example of release branch naming:
::

    release/v1.3

Git release tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to release branches, release tags are created for each actual
release (this may include release candidates that are intended for QA or beta
testing, as well as public releases). The release tags are made in the
corresponding release branch.

The commit that represents a specific release is tagged with a tag named
`vX.Y.Z`, optionally suffixed with a textual identifier, such as `-alpha`,
`beta`, `-rc1`.

Example of release tag:
::

    v1.3.2-rc1

Patch versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first release version from the `vX.Y` release branch, is tagged with the
patch version `0`, eg. `vX.Y.0`. Every time a bug-fix is included in a release
branch the patch version is raised (to comply with Semantic Versioning) by
setting a new tag.

When no more bugs are found, tag the tip of the release branch with `vX.Y.Z`
(it is no longer a release candidate), and if necessary make a final build (e.g.
to get the release number correct in the release package etc).

Continuous Integration (placeholder)
------------------------------------

TODO Write notes and instructions for continuous integration.


Future milestones
=================

Future milestones are divided into several different phases, some of which can
be pursued independently.


Audit usage
-----------

Future development work may involve restructuring the application code and
applying technical upgrades to underlying frameworks. The technical direction
of code changes also relies on ensuring that the Web Curator Tool meets the
needs of its current and potential future users. Application functionality needs
verification throughout all steps of restructuring, uplift and functional
enhancement. For this reason, developers need to understand and duplicate
current usage by:

1.  Understanding who uses the Web Curator Tool and how they use it.

2.  Provide a set of key user journeys. These user journeys cover all essential
    functionality in how the tool is used.

3.  Write unit and/or integration tests that cover those essential user journeys.
    These tests are used to ensure that all essential functionality remains
    through all development changes.


Containerization and continuous integration
-------------------------------------------

Containerization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Containerization ensures that each Web Curator Tool can run in its own
container connected to other containers. (TODO Describe the advantages of
containerization and what it means for the WCT).

Repository split
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Splitting the single Web Curator Tool into multiple repositories means that the
each component can be developed, built, versioned and released independently
from the other components. This provides the advantage of decoupling the
components. Decoupling is predicated on reliable interfaces connecting each
component.

Continuous integration through build and deploy pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A preconfigured build and deploy pipeline (or pipeline template) allows
developers to quickly build and test changes and put new releases into
production.

Ease of installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part of the reason to move to a containerisation approach with a build and
deploy pipeline is to make it easier for users to easily build, stand up and
run the Web Curator Tool in a production environment. It also means that
component upgrades are much easier to roll out by component (so one component
can receive an upgrade/code change without requiring all components be changed).


Quality assurance improvements
------------------------------

In addition to providing a testable set of user journeys and an easy-to-use
build and deploy pipeline, additional changes that ensure code quality,
including:

-   More comprehensive logging at all API points.

-   Better enforcement of coding quality and standards through build-time
    enforcement using such things as PMD static code analysis
    (https://pmd.github.io/ ), Jacoco code coverage
    (https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/ ), FindBugs
    (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/ ), Checkstyle for coding style
    (http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ ), SonarQube for code quality
    (https://www.sonarqube.org/ ) and others.

-   Switch to Test-Driven Development.

-   Consistently applied coding and development standards.


Component based REST API
------------------------

APIs ensure that the different components can talk to each other through
standard interfaces. Currently communication between components is handled via
SOAP interfaces. The technical uplift would move the API interfaces to REST.
The API would allow for decoupling of the components and more flexibility in
how the Web Curator Tool is structured for use in production. Several potential
API candidates exist:

1.  Agent API - A generic wrapper supporting different crawlers, such as
    Heritrix1, Heritrix3 and other potential crawlers, such as WebRecorder.
    Re-develop WCT Core and Harvest Agent to be crawler agnostic, allowing other
    crawl tools to be utilised by WCT. Harvest Agent pooling/grouping also
    required to allocate scheduled Targets to different crawl tools.

2.  Workflow API - This would separate out the workflow into a separate
    component to allow easier integration with other systems.

3.  Administration API - For management of users, roles and other administrative
    components.

4.  Configuration API - For easier management of configuration so that
    run time values are contained in a single location instead of being spread
    across properties files, xml files and hard-coded in the codebase.


Technical uplift
----------------

Upgrade the frameworks and technologies that underpin the Web Curator Tool.
This technical shift is aimed at ensuring that the technologies used are
supported and effective.

Additional uplift notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Java 11 - OpenJDK has moved from version 8 to 11, so it makes sense to
    make the same leap. If the Web Curator Tool is a monolith, this could
    cause issues because it means that all co-located applications (as in, those
    applications running on the same machine) would need to upgrade as well.
    However, running the Web Curator Tool components in containers means that
    the container itself would have the Java version required.

-   Spring boot - Spring boot applications are deployed as Java jars. This can
    simplify application deployment.

-   REST (API) - In order to maintain a working Web Curator Tool throughout
    the upgrade process, the REST API would be incorporated into the existing
    codebase as upgraded component by component.

-   GUI framework - Exposing all Web Curator Tool functionality through REST API
    services allows for different GUI frameworks to run against the same API.
    Some research is necessary to determine a suitable technology, one that
    is well supported, easy to work with and having a large user base.

-   JPA (Hibernate) - Hibernate tends to obscure the underlying SQL. It may be
    more effective to write all SQL queries in ANSI SQL so they run across all
    database flavours without change. Using straight JDBC or MyBatis could make
    development and maintenance much easier to understand, allowing less
    experienced (and not Hibernate savvy) developers participate. There doesn't
    seem to be an inherent requirement for using SQL, so consider whether NoSQL
    might work better.
