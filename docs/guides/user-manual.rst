About the Web Curator Tool
--------------------------

The Web Curator Tool is a tool for managing the selective web harvesting
process. It is typically used at national libraries and other collecting
institutions to preserve online documentary heritage.

Unlike previous tools, it is enterprise-class software, and is designed
for non-technical users like librarians. The software was developed
jointly by the National Library of New Zealand and the British Library,
and has been released as free software for the benefit of the
international collecting community.

About this document
-------------------

This document is the Web Curator Tool User Manual. It describes how to
use the Web Curator Tool through its web browser interface. It assumes
your system administrator has already set up the Web Curator Tool.

The manual is divided into chapters, each of which deals with a
different aspect of the tool. The chapters generally correspond to the
major Web Curator Tool modules.

System administrators will find an Administrators Guide and other
technical documentation on the Web Curator Tool website
(http://dia-nz.github.io/webcurator/).

System Overview
=========================

Background
----------

More and more of our documentary heritage is only available online, but
the impermanence and dynamic nature of this content poses significant
challenges to any collecting institutions attempting to acquire it.

To solve these problems, the National Library of New Zealand and The
British Library initiated a project to design and build a selective web
harvesting tool, which has now been released to the collecting community
as the Web Curator Tool.

Purpose and scope
-----------------

The tool is designed to manage the selective web archiving process. It
supports a harvesting workflow comprising a series of specialised tasks
with the two main business processes supported being acquisition and
description.

The Web Curator Tool supports:

- Harvest Authorisation: obtaining permission to harvest web material 
  and make it publicly accessible;

- Selection, scoping and scheduling: deciding what to harvest, how, and
  when;

- Description: adding basic Dublin Core metadata;

- Harvesting: downloading the selected material from the internet;

- Quality Review: ensuring the harvested material is of sufficient
  quality for archival purposes; and

- Archiving: submitting the harvest results to a digital archive.

The scope of the tool is carefully defined to focus on web harvesting.
It deliberately does not attempt to fulfil other enterprise functions:

-  it is not a digital repository or archive (an external repository or
   archive is required for storage and preservation)

-  it is not an access tool

-  it is not a cataloguing system (though it does provide some support
   for simple Dublin Core metadata)

-  it is not a document or records management system

Other, specialised tools can perform these functions more effectively
and the Web Curator Tool has been designed to interoperate with such
systems.

Essential terminology
---------------------

Important terms used with the Web Curator Tool include:

-  **Web Curator Tool** or **WCT** - a tool for managing the selective
   web harvesting process.

-  **Target** - a portion of the web you want to harvest, such as a
   website or a set of web pages. Target information includes crawler
   configuration details and a schedule of harvest dates.

-  **Target Instance** - a single harvest of a Target that is scheduled
   to occur (or which has already occurred) at a specific date and time.

-  **harvest** or **crawl** - the process of exploring the internet and
   retrieving specific web pages.

-  **harvest result** - the files that are retrieved during a
   **harvest**.

-  **seed** or **seed url** - a starting URL for a harvest, usually the
   root address of a website. Most harvests start with a seed and
   include all pages "below" that seed.

-  **harvest authorisation** - formal approval for you to harvest web
   material. You normally need permission to harvest the website, and
   also to store it and make it accessible.

-  **permission record** - a specific record of a harvest authorisation,
   including the authorising agencies, the dates during which
   permissions apply and any restrictions on harvesting or access.

-  **authorising agency** - a person or organisation who authorises a
   harvest; often a web site owner or copyright holder.

-  **indicator** - a quality assurance metric used to quantify the
   success of a harvest (e.g. the amount of content downloaded)

-  **recommendation** - the advice obtained by using one or more
   indicators to determine if a harvest successfully captured the
   content from a website

-  **automated QA** - the automated quality assurance process that runs
   after a harvest completes that provides a recommendation

-  **flag** - an arbitrary group created and assigned to one or more
   target instances

-  **reference crawl** - a target instance that has been archived and
   marked as a baseline to which all future harvests will be compared
   for a specific target

-  **harvest optimisation** - enables a harvest to run at the optimum
   time when there is available space in the schedule. The default is to
   look forward 12 hours (configurable).

-  **heat map** - a calendar 'pop up' that indicates the spread of
   scheduled harvests over a period of time.

Impact of the tool 
-------------------

The Web Curator Tool is used at the National Library of New Zealand, and
has had these impacts since it was introduced into the existing
selective web archiving programme:

-  Harvesting has become the responsibility of librarians and subject
   experts. These users control the software handling the technical
   details of web harvesting through their web browsers, and are much
   less reliant on technical support people.

-  Many harvest activities previously performed manually are now
   automated, such as scheduling harvests, regulating bandwidth,
   generating preservation metadata.

-  The institution's ability to harvest websites for archival purposes
   has been improved, and a more efficient and effective workflow is in
   place. The new workflow ensures material is safely managed from
   before it is harvested until the time it enters a digital archive.

-  The harvested material is captured in ARC/WARC format which has
   strong storage and archiving characteristics.

-  The system epitomises best practice through its use of auditing,
   permission management, and preservation metadata.

How Does it Work?
-----------------

The Web Curator Tool has the following major components

The Control Centre

-  The Control Centre includes an access-controlled web interface where
   users control the tool.

-  It has a database of selected websites, with associated permission
   records and other settings, and maintains a harvest queue of
   scheduled harvests.

Harvest Agents

-  When the Control Centre determines that a harvest is ready to start,
   it delegates it to one of its associated harvest agents.

-  The harvest agent is responsible for crawling the website using the
   Heritrix web harvester, and downloading the required web content in
   accordance with the harvester settings and any bandwidth
   restrictions.

-  Each installation can have more than one harvest agent, depending on
   the level of harvesting the organization undertakes.

Digital Asset Store

-  When a harvest agent completes a harvest, the results are stored on
   the digital asset store.

-  The Control Centre provides a set of quality review tools that allow
   users to assess the harvest results stored in the digital asset
   store.

-  Successful harvests can then be submitted to a digital archive for
   long-term preservation.

Harvest Authorisations
===============================

.. _introduction-1:

Introduction
------------

When you harvest a website, you are making a copy of a published
document. This means you must consider copyright law when you harvest
material, and also when you preserve it and when you make it accessible
to users.

The Web Curator Tool has a sophisticated **harvest authorisation
module** for recording your undertakings to copyright holders. Before
you can harvest web pages, you must first confirm you are authorised to
do so. The Web Curator Tool will record this information in its audit
trail so that the person or agency that authorised a particular harvest
can always be found. If you do not record who has authorised the
harvest, the Web Curator Tool will defer the harvest until you confirm
you are authorised.

In most cases, getting "harvest authorisation" means you must get
permission from the website owner before you start the harvest. The Web
Curator Tool lets you create harvest authorisation records that record
what website or document you have requested permission for, who has
authorised you to perform the crawl, whether you have been granted
permission, and any special conditions.

Some institutions, such as national libraries, operate under special
legislation and do not need to seek permission to harvest websites in
their jurisdiction. The Web Curator Tool supports these organisations by
allowing them to create a record that covers all such cases. See the
section on **Legislative and other sources of information** below.

In other cases, your institution may decide to harvest a website before
seeking permission, possibly because the target material is
time-critical and it is in the public interest to capture it right away.
In these cases, you must still record the entity who authorised the
crawl, even if it is a person in your organisation, or even you
yourself. This is also covered in the section on **Legislative and other
sources of information** below.

*Commercial search engines often harvest websites without seeking
permission from the owners. Remember that these services do not attempt
to preserve the websites, or to republish them, so have different legal
obligations.*

Terminology and status codes
----------------------------

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

Important terms used with the Harvest Authorisation module include:

-  **harvest authorisation** - formal approval for you to harvest web
   material. You normally need the copyright holder's permission to
   harvest the website, and also to store it and make it accessible.

-  **authorising agency** - a person or organisation who authorises a
   harvest; often a website owner or copyright holder.

-  **permission record** - a specific record of a harvest authorisation,
   including the authorising agencies, the dates during which
   permissions apply and any restrictions on harvesting or access.

-  **url pattern** - a way of describing a URL or a set of URLs that a
   permission record applies to. For example, http://www.example.com/\*
   is a pattern representing all the URLs on the website at
   www.example.com.

Permission record status codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each permission record has one of these status codes:

-  **pending** - the permission record has been created, but permission
   has not yet been requested.

-  **requested** - a request for permission has been sent to the
   authorising agency, but no response has been received.

-  **approved** - the authorising agency has granted permission.

-  **rejected** - the authorising agency has refused permission.

URL Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~

URL Patterns are used to describe a portion of the internet that a
harvest authorisation applies to.

In the simplest case, a URL can be used as a URL Pattern. In more
complex cases, you can use the wildcard \* at the start of the domain or
end of the resource to match the permission to multiple URLs.

For example:

-  **http://www.alphabetsoup.com/\*** -include all resources within the
   Alphabet Soup site (a standard permission granted directly by a
   company)

-  **http://www.alphabetsoup.com/resource/\*** -include only the pages
   within the 'resource' section of the Alphabet Soup site

-  **http://*.alphabetsoup.com/\*** -include all resources on all sub
   sites of the specified domain.

-  **http://www.govt.nz/\*** -include all pages on the domain
   www.govt.nz

-  **http://*.govt.nz/\*** -include all NZ Government sites

-  **http://*.nz/\*** -include all sites in the \*.nz domain space (this
   can be used to supports a national permission based on government
   legislation)

How harvest authorisations work
-------------------------------

Each harvest authorisation contains four major components:

-  A name and description for identifying the harvest authorisation,
   plus other **general information** such as an order number.

-  One or more **authorising agencies**\ *,* being the person or
   organisation who authorises the harvest. This is often a website
   owner or copyright holder. Some authorising agencies may be
   associated with more than one harvest authorisation.

-  A set of **url patterns** that describe the portion of the internet
   that the harvest authorisation applies to.

-  One or more **permission records** that record a specific permission
   requested from an authorising agency, including

   -  a set of URL patterns,

   -  the state of the request (pending, requested, approved, rejected),

   -  the time period the request applies to, and

   -  any special conditions or access restrictions (such as 'only users
      in the Library can view the content').

In most cases, only users with specific roles will be allowed to manage
harvest authorisations. Unlike some other Web Curator Tool objects,
harvest authorisations do not have an "owner" who is responsible for
them.

Sample harvest authorisation
----------------------------

For example, to harvest web pages from 'The Alphabet Soup Company', you
might create a harvest authorisation record called 'Alphabet Soup'. This
would include:

-  **general information** recording the company name and the library
   order number for this request:

   -  Name: 'Alphabet Soup'

   -  Order Number: "AUTH 2007/03"

-  **url patterns** to identify the company's three websites:

   -  http://www.alphabsetsoup.com/\*

   -  http://www2.alphabsetsoup.com/\*

   -  http://extranet.alphabsetsoup.com/\*

-  **authorising agencies** for the two organisations responsible for
   the content on these sites:

   -  The Alphabet Soup Company

   -  Food Incorporated.

-  **permission records**, linking each authorising agency with one or
   more URL patterns:

   -  The Alphabet Soup Company to approve restriction-free access, on
      an open-ended basis, to http://www.alphabetsoup.com/\ \* and
      http://www2.alphabetsoup.com/\ \*

   -  Food Incorporated to approve NZ-only access, for the period
      1/1/2006 through 31/12/2006, to http://www.alphabetsoup.com/\ \*
      and http://www2.alphabetsoup.com/\ \*.

Harvest authorisation search page
---------------------------------

The harvest authorisation search page lets you find and manage harvest
authorisations.

.. figure:: ../_static/user-manual/image6.png
    :target: ../_static/user-manual/image6.png

    Figure 2. Harvest Authorisations

At the top of the page are:

-  Fields to enter search criteria for existing harvest authorisation
   records (**Identifier**, **Name**, **Authorising Agent**, **Order
   Number, Agency, URL Pattern, Permissions File Reference** and
   **Permissions Status**), and a search button for launching a search.

-  There is also a drop down list that allows the user to define a sort
   order for the returned results **(name ascending, name descending,
   most recent record displayed first, oldest record displayed first)**

-  A button to **create new** harvest authorisation requests.

Below that are search results. For each harvest authorisation record
found, you can:

|view| - **View** details

|Edit| - **Edit** details

|copy| - **Copy** the harvest authorisation and make a new one.

|generate| - **Generate a permission request letter**.

*The first time you visit this page, all the active harvest
authorisations for the user's Agency are shown. You can then change the
search parameters. On subsequent visits, the display is the same as the
last harvest authorisation search.*

**All search pages that present the search results in a 'page at a time'
fashion have been modified so that the user can elect to change the
default page size from 10 to 20, or 50 or even 100! The user's
preference will be remembered across sessions in a cookie.**

harvest the website, follow steps 1 through 5 below to change the Status
of the permission record to 'approved' (if permission is granted) or
'rejected' (if permission is declined).

The authorising agent may also specify special conditions, which should
be recorded in the permission record at this point.

1. From the harvest authorisation search page, click |Edit| next to the
   harvest authorisation request that includes the permission for which
   you sent the request letter.

*The* **General** *tab of the Create/Edit Harvest Authorisations page

18. If editing, you can change the **Status** of the permission to
    'approved' or 'rejected' as necessary, and click **Save**.

19. Click **Save** to close the Harvest Authorisation.

How to edit or view a harvest authorisation
-------------------------------------------

Editing an existing authorisation is very similar to the process for
creating a new record.

To start editing, go to the harvest authorisation search page, find the
harvest authorisation you wish to edit, and click the

|Edit|- **Edit** details

icon from the Actions column. This will load the harvest authorisation
into the editor. Note that some users will not have access to edit some
(or any) harvest authorisations.

An alternative to editing a harvest authorisation is to click the

|view| - **View** details

icon to open the harvest authorisation viewer. Data cannot be changed
from within the viewer. Once in the harvest authorisation viewer you may
also switch to the editor using the 'Edit' button

Legislative and other sources of authorisation 
-----------------------------------------------

Some national libraries and other collecting institutions have a
legislative mandate to harvest web material within their national
jurisdiction, and do not need to request permission from individual
copyright holders. In other cases, the library might rely on some other
source of authority to harvest material, or may choose to harvest before
permission is sought then seek permission retroactively.

The Web Curator Tool requires that every Seed URL be linked to a
permission record. When a library is specifically authorised to perform
harvests by legislation, this can seem like a source of inefficiency, as
no "permission" is really required.

However, the Web Curator Tool still requires a harvest record, so that
the ultimate source of harvest authority is always documented and
auditable.

When the tool is configured correctly, there should be no overhead in
most cases, and very little overhead in other cases.

This is possible through two mechanisms. First, the use of broad URL
Patterns allows us to create a permission record that is almost always
automatically assigned to Seed URLs without requiring any user action.
Second, the "Quick Pick" option in permission records makes the
permission record an option in the menu used to associate seeds with
permission records.

In practical terms, this means institutions can set up a single harvest
authorisation that applies to all their harvesting of their national
internet. It should be set up as follows:

-  **general information** should give the harvest authorisation a name
   that refers to the authorising legislation. For example:

   -  Name: "NZ e-legal deposit"

   -  Description: "All websites in the New Zealand domain acquired
      under legal deposit legislation"

-  **url patterns** should identify as much of the national website as
   possible. For example:

   -  http://\*.nz/\*

-  **an authorising agency** should describe the government that
   provided the mandate to harvest. For example:

   -  Name: "New Zealand Government"

   -  Contact: "National Librarian"

   -  Address: "National Library of New Zealand, Wellington"

-  **a permission record** should link the authorising agency with the
   URL patterns, as for other permission records. Some points to note:

   -  Dates: these fields should specify the date the legislation took
      (or takes) effect, and are typically open-ended.

   -  Status: Approved.

   -  Special restrictions / Access status: if your legislation places
      any restrictions on how the material may be harvested or access,
      record them here.

   -  **Quick Pick**: Selected.

   -  **Display Name**: The name used in the "Quick Pick" menu, such as
      "legal deposit legislation". The quick pick will show up in the
      seed tab of the Target record. See the Targets section for more
      information.

Targets
==================

.. _introduction-2:

Introduction
------------

In the Web Curator Tool, the portion of the web you have selected for
harvesting is called a **Target**.

In the simplest cases, a Target is a website: a single conceptual entity
that focuses on a particular topic or subject area, and which is hosted
on a single internet address. However, many Targets are much more
complicated (or much simpler) than this:

-  A Target can be a single document, such as a PDF file

-  A Target can be a part of a website, such as the Ministry of
   Education publications page, and all the PDF files it incorporates.

-  A Target can be a website distributed across several different hosts,
   such as the Turbine website, whose front page is hosted at
   http://www.vuw.ac.nz/turbine, and whose content is hosted on
   `www.nzetc.org.nz <http://www.nzetc.org.nz>`__.

-  A Target can be a collection of related websites, such as a set of
   political weblogs that provide discussion of a recent election.

   A Target can be an HTML serial issue located on a website

-  A Target could be any combination of these.

A Target is often referred to as the **unit of selection**: if there is
something desirable to harvest, archive, describe and make accessible,
then it is a Target.

.. _terminology-and-status-codes-1:

Terminology and status codes
----------------------------

.. _terminology-1:

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

Important terms used with the Web Curator Tool include:

-  **target** - a portion of the web you want to harvest, such as a web
   site or a set of web pages. Target includes crawler configuration
   details and a schedule of harvest dates.

-  **seed** or **seed url** - a starting URL for a harvest, such as the
   root address of a website. A harvest usually starts with a seed and
   includes all pages "below" that seed.

-  **approval** (of a target) - changing a Target into the **Approved**
   state. See the **How targets work** section below for an explanations
   of the implications of approval.

-  **cancelled** (of a target) - changing a Target into the
   **Cancelled** state. This has the effect of deleting all scheduled
   Target Instances associated with the Target.

Target status 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Target has a status:

-  **pending** - a work in progress, not ready for approval

-  **nominated** - completed and ready for approval

-  **rejected** - rejected by the approver, usually because the Target
   was unsuitable or because it had an issue with permissions. You need
   to select a reason why a target was rejected.

   **approved** - complete and certified as ready for harvest

-  **complete** -all scheduled harvests are complete

-  **cancelled** - the Target was cancelled before all harvests were
   completed

-  **reinstated** - the Target was reinstated from the complete,
   cancelled, or rejected state but is not yet ready for approval
   (equivalent to **pending**)

How targets work
----------------

Targets consist of several important elements, including a name and
description for internal use; a set of Seed URLs, a web harvester
profile that controls the behaviour of the web crawler during the
harvest, one or more schedules that specify when the Target will be
harvested, and (optionally) a set of descriptive metadata for the
Target.

Seed URLS
~~~~~~~~~

The Seed URLs are a set of one or more URLs that form the starting
point(s) for the harvest, and are used to define the scope of the
harvest. For example, the Seed URL for the University of Canterbury
website is http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/ and (by implication) the website
includes all the other pages on that server.

Each Seed URL must be linked to at least one current, approved
permission record before any harvests can proceed for the Target.

Schedules
~~~~~~~~~

A Schedule is added to a Target to specify when (and how often) the
Target will be harvested. For example, you may want a Target to be
harvested every Monday at midnight, or on the first of every month at
5AM, or every day at Noon for the next two weeks. Alternatively, you can
request that a Target be harvested only once, as soon as possible.
Multiple schedules can be added to each Target.

Nomination
~~~~~~~~~~

After a Target has been created, has its Seed URLs added, has a schedule
attached, and has all the other necessary information set, it is changed
into the Nominated state. This indicates that the owner believes the
Target is ready to be harvested.

Approval
~~~~~~~~

A nominated Target must be **Approved** before any harvests will be
performed.

Approving a Target is an action that is usually reserved for senior
users, as it has several implications and consequences. First, approving
a Target is a formal act of selection: the Approver is saying that the
Target is a resource that the Library wishes to collect. Second,
approving a Target is an act of verification: the Approver is confirming
that the Target is correctly configured, that its schedule is
appropriate, and that its permissions do authorise the scope and
frequency of the scheduled harvests. Finally, approving a Target as a
functional aspect: it tells the Web Curator Tool to add the scheduled
harvests to the Harvest Queue.

Completion, Cancellation, and Reinstatement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When all the harvests scheduled for a Target have finished, the Target
automatically changes from the Approved state to the Completed state.

Sometime a user will change the state of an Approved Target to Cancelled
before all the harvests are complete. This means that all scheduled
harvests will be deleted.

Some users will have access to change a Completed or Cancelled Target to
the Reinstated state, at which point they can edit the Target (for
example, attaching a new schedule) and nominate it for harvest again.

Target search page
------------------

You manage Targets from the **Target search** page:

|image21|

   Figure 10. Target search page

At the top of the page are:

-  fields to search for existing targets by **ID, Name**, **Seed URL**,
   **Agency**, **User**, **Sort Order, Description, Member of,
   Non-Display Only and State**

-  The search panel contains a drop down list allowing the user to
   control the sort order of the search results. E.g. 'Most recent
   first' will display the targets with the most recently created target
   listed first.

-  The Description field allows you to search for information found in
   the target description field

-  The Member of field allows you to search for targets found in a
   particular Group.

-  Non-Display allows you to search for targets that are ticked as
   non-display in the Target Access tab

-  a button to **create new** Targets

You can enter search terms in any or all of the textboxes and menus, and
select any number of states. All the text boxes contain simple text
strings, except for Seed (URLs) and ID (Target ID numbers).

Search criteria will be combined as an AND query and the matching
records retrieved. The default search is for Targets that you own.

*Searches in text boxes are case-insensitive, and match against the
prefix of the value. For example, a search for "computer" in the name
field might return Targets named "Computer warehouse" and
"Computerworld", but not "Fred's computer".*

*You can perform wildcard characters to perform more complex text
matches. The percent (%) character can be used to match zero or more
letters, and the underscore (_) to match one character. So, for example,
a search for "%computer" would match "Computer warehouse" and
"Computerworld" and "Fred's computer"*


Below that are search results, with options to:

|view| - **View** the Target

|Edit| - **Edit** the Target

|copy| - **Copy** the Target and create a new one

|image22| - **View** the Target Instances derived from this
Target

|image23| - **Delete** the Target. This action can only be done when the
target is in the pending state

How to create a target
----------------------

From the Targets page,

1. Click **create new**.

*The* **Create/Edit Targets** *page displays.*

|image24|

Figure 11. Create/Edit Targets

The **Create/Edit Targets** page includes several tabs for adding or
editing information about Targets:

-  **General** - general information about the Target, such as a name,
   description, owner, and status

-  **Seeds** - base URLs for websites to harvest

-  **Profile** - technical instructions on how to harvest the Target

-  **Schedule** - dates and times to perform the harvest

-  **Annotations** - notes about the Target

-  **Description** - metadata about the Target

-  **Access** - settings regarding access to the harvested Target

Enter general information about the target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2. On the **General** tab, enter basic information about the Target.
   When editing an existing Target, a 'View Target Instances' link is
   displayed to the right of the 'Name' field. Clicking this link
   displays the Target Instances screen with all Target Instances
   matching the Target name.

3. Reference number is optional. e.g. The National Library of New
   Zealand adds the catalogue record number here and their WCT system is
   configured so that no website can be archived into their National
   Digital Heritage Archive without this number being present in the
   target record.

4. '**Run on approval**' If you check this box you can prepare the
   target record so that the harvest is ready to run once you set the
   Harvest Authorisation permissions form to "Approved". To do this
   approve the target itself, add the seed URL and pending permission
   and schedule as instructed below.

   **NB.** 'Run on approval' sets an immediate harvest one minute into
   the future, but until the harvest authorisation is approved the
   harvest itself will keep deferring 24 hours until the harvest
   authorisation is set to approved.

5. Enabling the **Auto-prune** checkbox causes WCT to identify pruned
   items from the last archived harvest and prunes those items from
   subsequent harvests.

6. **Note to Archivists** - An optional note.

*The Required fields are marked with a red star. When the form is
submitted, the system will validate your entries and let you know if you
leave out any required information.*

Enter the sites you want to harvest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

7. Click the **Seeds** tab.

8. The **Seeds** tab includes a box for adding the base URL of each web
   site you want to harvest and list of previously added seeds.

|image25|

Figure 12. Seeds tab

9.  Enter the root URL of a website for this Target.

10. Select a permission record (or records) that **authorise** you to
    harvest the seed:

-  **Auto** will automatically find all permission records whose URL
   Patterns match the seed.

-  **Add Later** enters the seed without to any permissions (the Target
   cannot be Approved until a permission is added).

-  **Quick Picks**. See the harvest authorisation section for directions
   on how to create these.

-  **NB.** If your seed URL doesn't match the seed URL pattern in the
   permission record you want to use (e.g. a '.com' site that is in
   scope for Legal Deposit) it will still run when you link it to the
   approved Harvest Authorisation.

11. Click **link**. Repeat for additional sites.

The seed displays in the list below.

*You can also use the* **Import** *button to import a precompiled list of
seeds from a text file. The text file should have one URL per line.*

*The multiple selection bar at the bottom of the list allows you to link,
unlink and delete multiple selected seeds.*

You can edit the seed URL after it has been linked. Click on the edit
icon |Edit| , make the changes, and then click on the save icon |save|.

Select a profile and any overrides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

12. Click the **Profile** tab.

*The Profile tab includes a list of harvest profiles, and a series of
options to override them. Generally, the default settings are fine. There
are two types of harvest profiles to choose from:*

   - Heritrix 1
   - Heritrix 3

*See the Target Instance Quality Review section for further information
about overriding profiles.*

Enter a schedule for the target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

13. Click the **Schedule** tab.

*The* **Schedule** *tab includes a list of schedules and a button to create
a new schedule.*

|image26|

   Figure 13. Schedule tab

14. **Harvest now** - ticking this box will schedule a one off harvest 5
    minutes after saving the record.

    **NB**: If you click on 'harvest now' and the target is in the
    completed state you will now a prompt to inform you that it's
    possible if you have the authority to do so. The National Library of
    New Zealand also uses WCT to harvest HTML serials (as a separate
    agency). They don't use schedules and they don't want to reinstate a
    target in the completed state and have to approve the target every
    time a new serial issue is harvested.

15. **Harvest optimization**. See the Management section for information
    about setting this up.

16. Click **create new**.

*The* **Create/Edit Schedule** *page displays fields for entering a
schedule.*

|image27|

   Figure 14. Create/Edit Schedule

17. Enter **From** and **To** dates for when the harvest will run;
    select a **Type** of schedule, e.g. 'Every Monday at 9:00pm' or
    'Custom'

18. If you select 'Custom', enter details of the schedule; and click
    **Save**. Figure 14 shows a fortnightly schedule. A two-yearly
    schedule can be set up in **Years** e.g. 2013/2 means the next
    scheduled harvest would be 2015.

    The scheduling uses Cron expressions. For more information about how
    to use these expressions go to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron

19. The **Heat map** pop up displays a calendar indicating the level of
    harvesting scheduled for each day, so you can schedule harvests on
    less busy days if required. The thresholds and colour coding can be
    set in the Harvester Configuration under the Management section.

Annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~

20. Click the **Annotations** tab.

21. The **Annotations** tab allows you to record internal and selection
    information about the Target. The Annotations are intended for
    internal use, but are included in submissions to archives.

22. Annotations can be modified or deleted after creation by the user
    who created them. When an annotation is modified, the annotation
    date is automatically updated to the time of modification.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

23. Click the **Description** tab.

*The* **Description** *tab includes a set of fields for storing Dublin Core
metadata. This not used in the Web Curator Tool, but is included when
any harvests are submitted to a digital archive.*

Groups
~~~~~~

24. Click the **Groups** tab.

*The* **Groups** *tab allows you to add Targets to Web Curator Tool groups,
such as collections, events or subjects. See the chapter on Groups for
more information.*

Access
~~~~~~

25. Click the **Access** tab.

*The* **Access** *tab allows you to specify a Display Target flag, Display
Notes and an Access Zone from*

-  *Public(default)*

-  *Onsite*

-  *Restricted*

|image28|

   Figure 15. Access Tab

The 'Reason for Display Change' text field allows the user to record why
the Display Target flag was set or unset.

Save the completed target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

26. Click **save** at the bottom of the page to save the target.

   *You should pay close attention to the State the Target is saved in.
   When you are creating a new record, it will be saved in the 'Pending'
   state.*

How to edit or view a target
----------------------------

Editing an existing target is very similar to the process for creating a
new record.

To start editing, go to the Target search page, and click the

|Edit| - **Edit** details

icon from the Actions column. This will load the relevant Target editor.
Note that some users will not have access to edit some (or any) Targets.

An alternative to editing a Target is to click the

|view| - **View** details

icon to open the Target viewer. Targets cannot be changed from within
the viewer. Once in the Target viewer you may also switch to the editor
using the 'Edit' button

How to nominate and approve a target
------------------------------------

When you are creating a new record, it will be saved in the 'Pending'
state. This means that the Target is a work in progress, and not ready
for harvesting.

When the record is complete, you should **nominate** it for harvesting.
This signals to the other editors that your target is ready for
Approval.

An editor who has permission to approve targets will then review the
Target and make sure it is entirely correct, that it has the right Seed
URLs, that its permissions are present and correct, and that its
schedule is appropriately configured. They will then **approve** the
Target (which means that Target Instances will be created and harvests
will proceed).

Nominating
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open the Target in Edit mode.

   *The* **General** *tab will be displayed, and the* **State** *of the Target will be set to* **Pending**.

2. Change the state to **Nominated**.

3. Click **save** at the bottom of the page to save the Target.

.. _approval-1:

Approval
~~~~~~~~

4. Open the Target in Edit mode.

   *The* **General** *tab will be displayed, and the* **state** *of the Target will be set to* **Nominated**.

5. Change the state to **Approved**.

6. Click **save** at the bottom of the page to save the Target.

   *A set of Target Instances representing harvests of the Target will be created.*

   *Users with permission to Approve Targets will be able to set the
   state of a new target to Approved without going through the Nominated
   state.*

How to delete or cancel a target
--------------------------------

Targets can be deleted, but only if they have no attached Target
Instances.

However, once a Target Instance enters the Running (or Queued) state, it
can no longer be deleted from the system. In other words, a Target
cannot be deleted if it has been harvested (even if that harvest was
unsuccessful). This restriction is necessary so that the Web Curator
Tool retains a record of all the harvests attempted in the tool in case
it is needed later for audit purposes.

Targets that are no longer required should be left in the **Cancelled**
state. Targets whose scheduled harvests have all been completed will be
changed to the **Completed** state. Both cancelled and completed targets
can be changed to the **Reinstated** state and re-used.

Targets can be set to a **Rejected** state and in this case the tool
allows the user to nominate a reason for the rejection from a drop down
list whose contents are defined by system administrators using the
administration screen for Rejection Reasons.

Target Instances and Scheduling
=========================================

.. _introduction-3:

Introduction
------------

**Target Instances** are individual harvests that are scheduled to
happen, or that are currently in progress, or that have already
finished. They are created automatically when a Target is **Approved**.

For example, a target might specify that a particular website should be
harvested every Monday at 9pm. When the target is Approved, a Target
Instance is created representing the harvest run at 9pm on Monday 24
July 2006, and other Target Instances are created for each subsequent
Monday.

.. _terminology-and-status-codes-2:

Terminology and status codes
----------------------------

.. _terminology-2:

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

Important terms used with the Web Curator Tool include:

-  **target instance** - a single harvest of a Target that is scheduled
   to occur (or which has already occurred) at a specific date and time.

-  **Queue or harvest queue** - the sequence of future harvests that are
   scheduled to be performed.

-  **harvest** - the process of crawling the web and retrieving specific
   web pages.

-  **harvest result** - the files that are retrieved during a
   **harvest**.

-  **quality review** - the process of manually checking a **harvest
   result** to se if it is of sufficient quality to archive.

Target instance status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Target Instance has a status:

-  **scheduled** - waiting for the scheduled harvest date and time.

-  **queued** - the scheduled start time has passed, but the harvest
   cannot be run immediately because there are no slots available on the
   harvest agents, or there is not enough bandwidth available.

-  **running**  - in the process of harvesting.

-  **stopping** - harvesting is finished and the harvest result is being
   copied to the digital asset store (this is a sub-state of
   **running**).

-  **paused** - paused during harvesting.

-  **aborted** - the harvest was manually aborted, deleting any
   collected data.

-  **harvested** - completed or stopped; data collected is available for
   review

-  **endorsed** - harvested data reviewed and deemed suitable for
   archiving

-  **rejected** - harvested data reviewed and found not suitable for
   archiving (ie, content is incomplete or not required)

-  **archiving** - in the process of submitting a harvest to the archive
   (this is a sub-state of **archived**).

-  **archived** - harvested content submitted to the archive.

How target instances work
-------------------------

Target Instances are created when a Target is approved.

Scheduling and Harvesting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Target Instances are always created in the **scheduled** state, and
always have a Scheduled Harvest Date.

The scheduled Target Instances are kept in the Harvest Queue. Examining
this queue (by clicking on the **queue** button on the homepage) gives
you a good overview of the current state of the system and what
scheduled harvests are coming up next.

When the scheduled start time arrives for a scheduled Target Instance,
the Web Curator Tool makes a final check that the permission records for
this harvest are valid. If the Target Instance is appropriately
authorised, the harvest is started and the state of the Target Instance
changes to **Running**.

When the harvest is complete, the Harvest Result is ready for quality
review, and the Target Instance state is changed to **Harvested**.

Quality Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a harvest finishes, the Web Curator Tool notifies its owner, who
has to Quality Review the harvest result to verify that the harvest was
successful and that it downloaded all the necessary parts of the
website.

Several tools are provided for supporting the quality review function,
these are described in detail in the next chapter.

When the Target Instance owner has finished reviewing a harvest result,
they must decide whether it is of acceptable quality for the digital
archive. If it fails this test, the user marks the Target Instance as
**rejected**, and the harvest result is deleted. No further action can
be performed on the Target Instance, though the user can attempt to make
adjustments to the scope of the Target in order to get a better result
the next item it is harvested.

If the harvest result is successful, the user can **endorse** it to
indicate that it is ready for inclusion in the digital archive.

Submitting a Harvest to the Digital Archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a Target Instance has been Endorsed, it can be **submitted** to the
archive for long-term storage and subsequent access by users. At this
point, the harvest result leaves the control of the Web Curator Tool,
and becomes the responsibility of the archive. The harvest result will
eventually be deleted from the Web Curator Tool, but metadata about the
Target Instance will be permanently retained.

Target instance page
--------------------

You manage Target Instances from the **Target Instance page**:

|image30|

Figure 16. Target Instances

NB: the homepage images are pointing to the live site. WCT is configured
so that you can switch off this functionality if this slows your
system's performance.

At the top of the page are fields to search for existing target
instances by **ID,** **start date** (**From**, **To**), **Agency**,
**Owner**, Target **Name, Flagged** Target Instances and **State** and
**QA Recommendation**.

   The search page remembers your last search and repeats it as the
   default search, with two exceptions. If you navigate to the Target
   Instance search page by clicking the "open" button on the homepage,
   it will show all the Target Instances that you own. And if you
   navigate to the page by clicking the "Queue" button on the homepage,
   or the "Queue" link at the top right of any page, it will show the
   Target Instances that make up the current harvest queue. If you
   navigate to the Target Instance search page by clicking the
   "harvested" button on the homepage, it will show all the Target
   Instances that you own that are in the 'Harvested' state, and if you
   navigate to the Target Instance search page from the Target General
   tab by clicking the "View Target Instances" link, it will show all
   the Target Instances that match the Target name. Once in the Target
   Instance viewer you may also switch to the editor using the 'Edit'
   button

The search results are listed at the bottom of the page. For each, you
may have these options, depending on its state and your permissions:

|view| - **View** the Target Instance

|Edit| - **Edit** the Target Instance

|delete| - **Delete** a scheduled or queued Target Instance

|image32| - **Harvest** a scheduled Target Instance immediately

|image33| - **Pause** a running Target Instance

|image34| - **Stop** a running Target Instance and save its patrial
harvest result

|image35| - **Abort** a running Target Instance and delete its harvest
result

|image97| - **H3 Script Console** for executing scripts against
Heritrix 3 Target Instances

|image36| - **Target Annotation**: displays any annotations defined for
this target instance's target.

Operations on multiple target instances can be performed using the
**Multi-select Action** radio button. Note that the target instance
checkbox will be enabled only for those target instances in a valid
state for the selected multi-select action:

- **delist**: cancels all future schedules for the selected target
  instances.

- **endorse**: endorses the selected target instances.

- **archive**: archives the selected target instances.

- **delete**: deletes all selected target instances in a valid state (eg:
  scheduled target instances).

- **reject**: when selected, a rejection reason drop-down box is displayed
  and clicking the action button will reject the selected target instances
  with the selected rejection reason:

|image37|

Figure 17. Rejecting a target instance

Sortable fields:

    |image38| Clicking on the **Name**, **Harvest Date**, **State**, **Run
    Time**, **URLs**, **% Failed** or **Crawls** columns will sort the
    search results by that column.

    |image39| Clicking the same column again will perform a reverse sort of
    the column

    |image40| Hovering over the QA Recommendation will display a list of the
    three most recent harvest status and any annotations for the target
    instance:

    |image41|

    Figure 18. Sortable fields

Scheduling and the harvest queue
--------------------------------

Target Instance Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Target Instances are created when a Target is **approved**. They are
always created in the **scheduled** state, and always have a Scheduled
Harvest Date (which is actually a date and time).

The Target Instances are created in accordance with the Target's
Schedule (or Schedules). Target Instances will be created three months
in advance of their scheduled harvest date (this period is
configurable), and the first Target Instance is always scheduled (even
if it is outside the three month window).

If the **Run on Approval** box is checked on the General Tab of the
Target, then an additional Target Instance will be created with a
Scheduled Harvest Date one minute in the future.

Examining the Harvest Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Scheduled Target Instances are kept in the Harvest Queue. You can
view the queue by clicking on the **queue** button on the homepage. It
gives you a good overview of the current state of the system and what
scheduled harvests are coming up next.

The queue view is shown in the figure below.

|image42|

Figure 19. Harvest queue

The queue view is actually just a predefined search for all the Target
Instances that are Running, Paused, Queued (i.e. postponed), or
Scheduled.

Running a Harvest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the scheduled start time arrives for a Scheduled Target Instance,
the Web Curator Tool makes final checks that the permission records for
this harvest are valid. If the harvest is appropriately authorised, then
the Web Curator Tool will normally allocate it to one of the Harvest
Agents, which invokes the Heritrix web crawler to harvest the site (as
directed by the profile tab in the Target). For example, if a Target
Instance is assigned to a Heritrix 3 profile, then it will be allocated
to a Heritrix 3 Harvest Agent. The Target Instance State
will be updated to **running**.

Some users may have the option of using the |image43| - '**Harvest** a
Scheduled Target Instance immediately' icon to launch the harvest before
its Scheduled Start Date arrives.

Queued Target Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a harvest cannot be run because there is no capacity on the
system: either the maximum number of harvests are already running, or
there is no spare bandwidth available for an additional harvest.

In these cases, the Target Instance cannot be sent to the Harvest
Agents. Instead, their state is updated to **queued**, and they remain
in the Harvest Queue. The harvest is run as soon as capacity becomes
available on a Harvest Agent.

Deferring Target Instances 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a Target Instance is scheduled to run, but the Target it is
based on has one or more permission records attached that are still in
the pending state. In other words, permission has not (yet) been granted
for this harvest.

In this situation, the Scheduled Start Date of the Target instance is
moved forward by 24 hours (its state remains scheduled). At the same
time, a notification is sent to the Target Instance owner to tell them
the harvest has been **deferred**.

Deleting Target Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only Target Instances in the Scheduled or Queued states can be deleted.
A Target Instance in the Queued state may only be deleted if it has not
yet begun to harvest. Queued Target Instances that have previously begun
to harvest but have returned to the Queued state may not be deleted.

Once a Target Instances enters the Running state, it can no longer be
removed from the system. This means we retain information about every
crawl attempted by the Web Curator Tool in case we need it later for
audit purposes.

A Scheduled Target Instance that is deleted will not be run.

    *When the state of a Target changes from Approved to any other state,
    then all its Scheduled Target Instances will be immediately deleted.*

Harvested Target Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the harvest is complete, the Harvest Result is transferred to the
digital asset store, and the Target Instance state is changed to
**Harvested**. At this point, it is no longer part of the Harvest Queue.

To review target instances:
---------------------------

1. Click the name of the target instance to view the target instance
   summary page.

   The summary page is composed of panels that provide access to the
   QA Indicators and Recommendation, and draws together existing
   functionality into a single location.

   |image44|

    Figure 20. Target instance summary page

   -  **Harvest Results** - display the harvest results for the target
      instance; clicking the results displays the Harvest Results tab for
      the target instance

   -  **Profile Overrides** - access to the base profile for the target
      instance

   -  **Resources** - displays the seeds for the target instance; clicking
      a seed displays the Seeds tab for the target

   -  **Schedule** - enables modification of existing schedules

   -  **Key Indicators** - results of applying the Indicators defined in
      the System Administration Page for QA Indicators to the target
      instance; clicking a hyperlinked Indicator will display a generic
      report to explain the figure displayed. In the event that a target
      instance has been manually pruned, the **runQA** button is provided
      to re-compute the Indicator values and recommendation for the target
      instance.

   -  **Annotations** - lists the notes about the target instance.

   -  **Recommendation** - displays the final advice assigned to the target
      instance by considering all Indicator values. Hovering the mouse over
      the recommendation will display the advice for each indicator

      |image45|

   -  **Add Annotation** - enables notes for the target instance to be
      added.

   -  **Harvest History** - displays all harvest history for the target
      instance's target. The current harvest is highlighted in blue. The
      harvest history for an archived target instance will be displayed
      with a radio option and clicking **denote ref crawl** will mark the
      selected archived target instance as the reference crawl for future
      crawls

      |image46|

      When an archived target instance is denoted as a reference crawl, it
      is used as a baseline to compare the indicators for future crawls and
      is highlighted in red

      |image47|


2. From the Target summary page. click |view| to view a Target Instance,
   or |Edit| to edit a Target Instance.

   *The* **View/Edit Target Instance** *page displays.*

   |image48|

   Figure 21. View/Edit Target Instance

   The **View/Edit Target Instance** page includes six tabs for viewing,
   running, or editing information about a target instance:

   -  **General** - general information about the Target Instance, such the
      Target it belongs to, schedule, owner, agency, etc.

   -  **Profile** - technical instructions on how to harvest the Target.

   -  **Harvest State** - details of the harvest, for example total
      bandwidth and amount of data downloaded.

   -  **Logs** - access to log files recording technical details of the
      harvest.

   -  **Harvest Results** - access to harvested content with options to
      review, endorse, reject, and archive harvest results.

   -  **Annotations** - notes about the Target Instance.

   -  **Display** - settings regarding the eventual display of the Target
      Instance in a browsing tool.

How to review, endorse or submit a target instance
--------------------------------------------------

3. Open the Target Instance in Edit mode, and click the **Harvest
   Results** tab.

   *A list of target results displays.*

   |image49|

   Figure 22. Harvest Results tab

.. _quality-review-1:

Quality Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4. To review a result, click **Review.**

   *Quality Review is a complex task, and is covered separately in the next chapter.*

Endorse or Reject harvest results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have finished reviewing a Target Instance, the **Done** button
will return you to the harvest results page. At this point, you should
know whether the harvest was successful, and should be **Endorsed**, or
was unsuccessful, and should be **Rejected**.

5. To endorse the results, click **Endorse**.

6. To reject the results, click **Reject** and the reason for rejecting
   the TI.

Submit harvest results to an archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have endorsed a Target Instance, two new buttons appear that
read '**Submit to Archive'** and **'Un-Endorse'**.

7. To archive an endorsed result, click **Submit to Archive**.

8. To un-endorse an erroneously endorsed instance, click **Un-Endorse**,
   this will set the target instance back to the **harvested** state.

    *The Reject, Endorse, Un-Endorse and Submit to Archive links will*
    *automatically Save the Target Instance for you. You do not need to click*
    *on the* **save** *button after these operations (it won't hurt if you do).*

Target Instance Quality Review
========================================

.. _introduction-4:

Introduction
------------

**Target Instances** are individual harvests that are scheduled to
happen, or that are currently in progress, or that have already
finished. See the previous chapter for an overview.

When a harvest is complete, the harvest result is saved in the digital
asset store, and the Target Instance is saved in the Harvested state.
The next step is for the Target Instance Owner to Quality Review the
harvest result.

The first half of this chapter describes the quality review tools
available when reviewing harvest results. The second half describes some
problems that you may encounter when quality-reviewing harvest results
in the Web Curator Tool, and how to diagnose and solve them. This
includes detailed instructions and is intended for advanced users.

Terminology and status codes
----------------------------

.. _terminology-3:

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

Important terms used with the Web Curator Tool include:

-  **Target Instance** - a single harvest of a Target that is scheduled
   to occur (or which has already occurred) at a specific date and time.

-  **harvest** - the process of crawling the web and retrieving specific
   web pages.

-  **harvest result** - the files that are retrieved during a
   **harvest**.

-  **quality review** - the process of manually checking a **harvest
   result** to se if it is of sufficient quality to archive.

-  **live url** - the real version of a URL that is used by the original
   website on the internet.

-  **browse tool url** - the URL of a page in the **browse tool** (the
   browse tool URL is different for different harvest results).

    The browse tool URL is constructed as follows:
    http://wct.natlib.govt.nz/wct/curator/tools/browse/[Identifier]/[Live_URL]
    where [Identifier] is usually the Target Instance identifier, but may
    be an internal harvest result identifier.

Opening quality review tools
----------------------------

To review a harvested Target Instance, open it in edit mode, then select
the Harvest Results tab.

A list of Target results displays. If this is the first time you have
reviewed this Target Instance, a single Harvest Result will be
displayed.

|image51|

   Figure 23. Harvest Results tab

To review a result, click Review. The next screen shows the available
quality review tools.

*Options for reviewing display.*

|image52|

   Figure 24. Review Options

Quality review with the browse tool
-----------------------------------

The **Browse Tool** lets the user interact with a version of the harvest
result with their web browser. It is designed to simulate the experience
the user would have if they visited the original website. If the harvest
is successful, the harvested material offers a comparable user
experience to the original material.

The tool is controlled with a set of options in the Browse section of
the Quality Review Tools screen. The Seed URLs for the harvest are
listed at left, with three possible actions on the right:

-  **Review this Harvest** - Open a view of the harvested Seed URL in a new
   window of your web browser. If this option is enabled it uses the
   internal WCT Browse Tool to generate the page.

-  **Review in Access Tool** - Open a view of the harvested Seed URL in a
   new window of your web browser. If this option is enabled it uses an
   external Access Tool [1]_ to generate the page. This is the preferred
   browse tool.

-  **Live Site** - Open the original web page in a new window

-  **Archives Harvested** - Open any known archived versions of the site in a new window.

-  **Web Archive** - Open the site entry page in the public archive (eg:
   http://www.webarchive.org.uk or http://archive.org/web/web.php).

The **Review this harvest (WCT browse tool)** is no longer being
updated, which means some pages may not render properly. It is useful as
a backup browser if the Access Tool goes down\ *.* It is also useful if
you have several TI's of the same website harvested, as it only displays
the TI requested.

**The Review in Access Tool (OpenWayback)** is the preferred browser as it
is being maintained.

The **Live Site** link is provided so you can quickly open the original
site for a side-by-side comparison with the harvested version.

The **Archived Harvests** link lets you compare your harvest with
previous harvests of the website.

**Web Archive** By default, the Web Curator Tool will open a list pages
stored in the digital archive maintained by the Internet Archive, but
your administrator can configure the tool to use your local archive
instead.

Quality review with the harvest history tool
--------------------------------------------

The **Harvest History Tool** can be used to quickly compare the
harvest result of the current harvest to the result of previous harvests
of the same Target.

*The harvest history tool showing a history of the harvest results for a
website that has been harvested every year.*

|image53|

   Figure 25. Harvest History.

The tool shows all the harvests, with the most recent first. This allows
the user to compare current and previous statistics for the number of
pages downloaded, the number of download errors, the amount of data, and
other statistics. If the user clicks on the link they are taken to the
Target Instance view page corresponding to that particular harvest which
in turn has a link back to the back to the Harvest History page from
which they came.

Quality review with the prune tool
----------------------------------

The **Tree Tool** gives you a graphical, tree-like view of the harvested
data. It is a visualisation tool, but can also be used to delete
unwanted material from the harvest or add new material.

*A summary of the harvested web pages displayed in the tree tool.*

|image54|

   Figure 26. Tree Tool

When the tool is opened, a series of rows is presented. The first row
represents the complete harvest, and several additional columns are
provided with additional data about the harvest.

Subsequent rows contain summary information about each of the websites
visited during the crawl. These can be expanded to show the directories
and files that were harvested from within the website. Note that each
row may represent a page that was downloaded, or may represent a summary
statistic, or may fulfil both roles.

On each row, the following statistics are presented:

-  **Status** - The HTTP status for an entry that was downloaded.

-  **Size** - The size (in bytes) of an entry that was downloaded.

-  **Total URLs** - The number of attempts to download documents from
   "within" this site or folder.

-  **Total Success** - The number of documents successfully downloaded from
   "within" this site or folder.

-  **Total Failed** - The number of documents unsuccessfully downloaded
   from "within" this site or folder.

-  **Total Size** - The number of bytes downloaded from "within" this site
   or folder.

Users can browse the tree structure and then view, prune or insert
specific pages or files.

To view a page, select it in the display, and press the **view** button
- it is also possible to see the hop-path for a specific item by
clicking on the hop-path button.

To prune a page, or a set of pages:

-  Select the site, folder, or page that you want to prune

-  click Prune Single Item to remove just the highlighted page; or Prune
   Item and Children to remove the page and all the pages "within" it

To insert a new page or missing item (such as a graphics file):

-  Click on the folder in the Tree View where the item should appear
   (see Figure 23 below)

-  Specify the full URL of the item as it should appear within the site
   harvest in **Specify Target URL**

-  Specify the appropriate file location on disk or the appropriate
   external URL for the new item which is to be added and click on the
   appropriate Import button.

-  The new item will be inserted at the appropriate place in the tree
   view hierarchy.

   Then after either type of action;

-  Add a description of why you have pruned or inserted content to the
   provenance note textbox (required).

-  Click Save. Note that for best efficiency it is best to combine
   multiple prune and import operations before saving - as a new Harvest
   Result is created after each operation which can be a very resource
   intensive operation on the server.

*The display returns to the Harvest Results tab.*

The log file viewer
-------------------

Although it is not a quality review tool, the Web Curator Tool log file
viewer can assist with quality review by letting you examine the log
files for Target Instances that that are running or harvested.

If you want the IP address associated with a harvested item to be
captured at the end of each line in the crawl.log file the profile being
used by the Heritrix Crawler for that harvest must contain a
post-processor class called IPAddressAnnotationInserter (see screen shot
of the relevant section of the post-processors tab in the profile
editor).

|image56|

The log file viewer is launched from the Logs tab of the Target Instance
edit pages, and by default the final 700 lines of the log are displayed.
However, there are several advanced features.

View the entire file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open a log in the Log File Viewer, then set the *Number of lines to
display* field to 99999 and click the update button. This will show the
entire log file (unless the harvest had more than 100,000 URLs).

View only the lines that contain a specified substring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *regular expression filter* box can be used to restrict the lines
that are displayed to only those that match a pattern (or "regular
expression").

For example:

-  **To show only lines that include report.pdf**: Set the regular
   expression filter to **.*report.pdf.\*** and press update.

   In the regular expression language, the dot
   (".") means "any character" and the star (asterisk, or "*")
   means "repeated zero or more times. So ".*" (which is often
   pronounced "dot-star") means any character repeated zero or more
   times, and the regular expression above means "show all the
   lines that have any sequence of characters, followed by
   "report.pdf", followed by any other sequence of characters.

-  **To find out whether a specific URL is in the crawl.log**: Suppose
   you want to see if http://www.example.com/some/file.html was
   downloaded. Open the crawl.log file in the Log File Viewer,
   enter the regular expression .\*http://www.example.com/some/file.html.\*
   and press update.

Diagnosing problems with completed harvests
-------------------------------------------

Many harvest problems only become evident once a harvest is complete and
loaded in the browse tool. For example, some images may not display
properly, or some stylesheets may not be loaded, or some links may not
work.

Diagnosis
~~~~~~~~~

In these cases, the general procedure is to

1. Determine the URL (or URLs) that are not working. Some good
   techniques are:

   -  Go to the live site, and find the page that the missing URL is
      linked from. Find out the missing URL by

      -  opening the document in the browser (applies to links, images)
         and reading the URL from the Location bar, or

      -  by right-clicking on the missing object (images and links), or

      -  by using view source to see the HTML (stylesheets), or

      -  by using the Web Developer Toolbar to view CSS information
         (Stylesheets-see Tools section below).

2. Determine whether the harvester downloaded the URL successfully. Here
   are some of the ways you might do this (from simplest to most
   complex):

   -  Open the Prune Tool and see if the URL is displayed. If the URL is
      not present, then it was **not downloaded** during the crawl.

   -  Calculate the browse tool URL, and see if it can be loaded in the
      Browse Tool. If so, the URL was **downloaded successfully**.

   -  Examine the crawl.log file in the Log File Viewer to see if the
      URL was harvested and what its status code was.

      -  If the URL is not in the crawl.log file, the URL was **not
         downloaded**.

      -  If the URL is in the crawl.log file with a status code
         indicating a successful download (such as 200, or some other
         code of the form 2XX) then the URL was **downloaded
         successfully**.

      -  If the URL is in the crawl.log file with a status code
         indicating a failed download (such as -1) then there was a
         **download error**. Check the Heritrix status codes are
         described in Section 4 below for information about what went
         wrong.

3. If the URL was **downloaded successfully** by the harvester but is
   not displaying, then there is a problem with the browse tool that
   needs to be fixed by an administrator or developer. The good news is
   that your harvest was (probably) successful-you just can't see the
   results.

   -  Some common cases in Web Curator Tool version 1.1 (which are fixed
      in later versions) include:

      -  web pages with empty anchor tags (SourceForge bug 1541022),

      -  paths that contain spaces (bug 1692829),

      -  some Javascript links (bug 1666472),

      -  some background images will not render (bug 1702552), and

      -  CSS files with import statements (bug 1701162).

   -  You should probably endorse the site if:

      -  there are relatively few URLs affected by the problem, or

      -  the information on the site is time critical and may not be
         available by the time Web Curator Tool 1.2 is installed.

4. If the URL was **not downloaded** by the harvester, determine why:

   -  It is possible that the crawl finished before the URL could be
      downloaded. Check to see if the state of the crawl (in the
      "Harvest State" tab of the Target Instance) says something like
      "Finished - Maximum document limit reached". To fix:

      -  Increase the relevant limit for the Target using the Profile
         Overrides tab.

      -  If this is a common problem, you may want to ask an
         administrator to increase the default limit set in the
         harvester profile.

   -  It is possible that the URL is out of scope for the crawl. The
      most obvious case is where the URL has a different host. It is
      also possible that the harvester is configured to only crawl the
      website to a certain depth, or to a certain number of hops (i.e.
      links from the homepage). To fix:

      -  For resources on different hosts, you can adjust the scope for
         the crawl by adding a new (secondary) seed URL.

      -  For path depth or hops issues, you can add a new secondary seed
         to extend the scope, or you can increase the relevant limit for
         the Target using the Profile Overrides tab.

   -  It is possible that the URL appears on a page that the Heritrix
      harvester cannot understand.

      -  URLs that appear in CSS, Shockwave Flash Javascript and other
         files will not be installed unless the harvest profile includes
         the correct "Extactor" plugin: ExtractorCSS, ExtractorSWF,
         ExtractorJS, etc. These will not be part of your profile (in
         WCT 1.1) unless your administrator adds them.

      -  URLs that appear in new or rare page types may not be parsed.

   -  It is possible that the URL does not appear explicitly on the
      page. For example, instead of linking to a URL directly, a
      Javascript function may be used to construct the URL out of
      several bits and pieces. To fix:

      -  There may be no easy way to fix this problem, since it is
         extremely hard for the harvester to interpret every single
         piece of Javascript it encounters (though it does try).

      -  If there are only one or two affected files, or if the affected
         files are very important, you can add the affected files as
         secondary seeds.

      -  If you are very lucky, all the affected files might be stored
         in the same location, such as a single directory, which can be
         crawled directly with a single additional seed.

5. If the URL was not retrieved because of a **download error** then the
   Heritrix status code can be used to diagnose the problem.

   -  See
      https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/wiki/Status-Codes
      for a list of Heritrix status codes.

   -  A 500 (or other 5XX) status code indicates an internal server
      error. If you see 500 status codes when you download with
      Heritrix, but are able to browse successfully in your web browser,
      it may be that the website is recognising the web curator tool and
      sending you errors (to prevent you from crawling the website). See
      the section on the Firefox User Agent Switcher below for
      information on diagnosing this problem. To resolve it, you can
      either negotiate with the web site administrator to allow you to
      harvest, or set up a profile that gives a false user agent string.

Common problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some common problems, and their solutions:

-  **Formatting not showing up in the browse tool**. We most often see
   this when a CSS file has not been downloaded (due to an oversight by
   the crawler). To see if this is the real problem, use "View Source"
   in your browser to identify the missing CSS file (or files-some pages
   have several), then check whether it was really downloaded. If not,
   try adding the CSS file as a secondary seed URL in the target and
   re-harvesting.

Diagnosing when too little material is harvested
------------------------------------------------

Sometimes a harvest fails to complete, or does not harvest as much material as
you expected. This section describes some common causes of this problem.

When no material is downloaded (the "61 bytes" result)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the screenshot below, the same website was harvested twice, and the
quantity of data harvested fell from 18 MB to 61 bytes. This tells us
that the second harvest has effectively failed.

*Two harvests of the same website, undertaken a month apart, showing a
dramatic change in the size of the harvest result.*

|image57|

Figure 28: Target Instance that failed to complete.

In these cases, the general procedure is to

1. Open the Target Instance (in either mode) and check the Harvest State
   tab to verify that the crawl is in the "Finished" state.

2. If the Target Instance Harvest State tab does not show the Finished
   state, then a message will usually explain the problem.

3. Open the Logs tab and check whether any error logs have been created.

   -  If there is a local-errors.log file, open it in the Log file
      viewer, and see what kind of errors are shown. Some examples:

      -  Errors that include "*Failed to get host [hostname] address
         from ServerCache*" indicate that the harvester was unable to
         look up the hostname in DNS, which probably means there was an
         error connecting to the internet (it may also mean you entered
         the URL incorrectly in the Target seed URLs).

When only the homepage is downloaded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases a harvest may appear to work, but will result in only the
homepage being visible in the browse tool. This can be because the seed
URL you have entered is an alias to the "real" URL for the website.

For example, the screenshot below shows the crawl.log file for a harvest
of the seed URL www.heartlands.govt.nz, which is successfully downloaded
(third line) but contains only a redirect to the "real" version of the
site at www.heartlandservices.govt.nz. This new web page is successfully
downloaded (line 6), and all its embedded images and stylesheets are
also downloaded (lines 7-19), but no further pages on
www.heartlandservices.govt.nz are harvested because the site is
out-of-scope relative to the seed URL.

|image58|

Figure 29. Crawl log

The solution to this problem is to add the "real" site as a primary or
secondary seed URL.

Diagnosing when too much material is harvested
----------------------------------------------

Sometimes a harvest will complete, and will look right in the browse
tool, but will appear to be far too large: either too many URLs were
downloaded, or you harvested more data than you expected.

Too many URLs downloaded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a harvest will be larger than expected, and will involve a
large number of URLs. The harvest will often show the following status
value in the Harvest Status tab of the Target Instance:

   **Finished - Maximum number of documents limit hit**

It is possible that the harvester has become caught in a "spider trap"
or some other unintended loop. The best way to investigate this problem
is to go to the Target Instance Logs tab, and to view the crawl.log file.
By default, this shows you the last 50 lines of the log file, and this
is where the problem is most likely to be.

For example, one recent harvest downloaded 100,000 documents, and
finished with the requests shown in this log file viewer window.

|image59|

Figure 30: the log file viewer showing the crawl log.

Note that many of the requests are repeated calls to the CGI script
http://whaleoil.co.nz/gallery2/main.php that include the parameters:

- g2_view=core.UserAdmin&g2_subView=core.UserLogin, or

- g2_view=core.UserAdmin&g2_subView=core.UserRecoverPassword

and that resolve to similar pages which have no real value to the
harvest. These URLs are spurious and should not be harvested (and
there are tens of thousands of them).

You can filter these URLs out of future harvests by going to the
associated Target and opening the Profile tab and adding the following
two lines to the "Exclude Filters" box for Heritrix 1 or "Block URLs" box
for Heritrix 3:

- .*g2_subView=core.UserLogin.\*

- .*g2_subView=core.UserRecoverPassword.\*

The first line will ensure that all URLs that match include the
substring 'g2_subView=core.UserLogin' will be excluded from future
harvests, and the second line will do the same for the "Recover Password" URLs.

|image95|

Third-party quality review tools
--------------------------------

The main tools used to diagnose harvest errors are your web browser, and
the WCT Quality Review Tools: the Browse Tool and the Prune Tool.
However, other tools that may be useful.

Web Developer Toolbar for Firefox and Chrome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Web Developer Toolbars provide a toolbar in the Firefox and Chrome web
browsers with numerous features for diagnosing problems with websites.

The full set of functionality is quite daunting, but these features can
be very useful:

-  **View the CSS information about a page**: Open the page in Firefox,
   then choose *View CSS* from the *CSS* menu. A new window (or tab)
   will be opened that lists all the stylesheets that were loaded in
   order to display the page, and which also show the contents of each
   of the stylesheets.

-  **View the URL Path of each image in a page**: Open the page in
   Firefox, then choose *Display Image Paths* from the *Image* menu.
   Each image will have its URL path superimposed over the image. (Use
   the same menu to turn it off again.)

-  **Get a list of all the links out of a page**: Open a page in
   Firefox, then choose *View Link Information* from the *Information*
   menu. A new window (or tab) will be opened that lists all the URLs
   that the page links to.

There are numerous other functions in the Web Developer Toolbar.

The Heritrix User Manual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Heritrix User Manual includes a section that explains how to
interpret Heritrix Log files-these are the same log files you see in the
Web Curator Tool.

Useful sections include:

-  | **Interpreting crawl.log**:
   | https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/wiki/Logs#crawllog

-  | **Status code definitions:** This explains the status codes that
   | appear in the crawl log:
   | https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/wiki/Status-Codes

-  | **Interpreting progress-statistics.log**:
   | https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/wiki/Logs#progress-statisticslog

-  **Interpreting Reports: See Section 8.3:**
   http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/analysis.html#logs

User Agent Switcher for Firefox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The User Agent Switcher addon for Firefox
(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59) provides a menu in
the Firefox web browser that lets you tell Firefox to request a page but
to identify itself as a different User Agent.

This is useful to identify those (thankfully rare) websites that give
one sort of content to some web agents (such as web browsers like
Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari), and other content to different
web browsers (such as Heritrix, Googlebot, etc).

To test whether this is happening to you, switch the user agent
Firefox is using to the one used in the Web Curator Tool, and
then attempt to browse the relevant site.

- Default Heritrix 1 string
  ``Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; heritrix/1.14.1 +http://dia-nz.github.io/webcurator/)``

- Default Heritrix 3 string
  ``Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; heritrix/3.3.0 +http://dia-nz.github.io/webcurator/``


.. _groups-1:

Groups
=================

Introduction
------------

Groups are a mechanism for associating two or more Targets that are
related in some way. For example, a Group might be used to associate all
the Targets that belong to a particular collection, subject, or event.

It is possible to create nested groups, where a specialised group (like
Hurricanes) is itself a member of a more general group, (such as Natural
Disasters).

Groups may have a start and end date. This can be used to define groups
that are based on events, such as elections.

In many ways, Groups behave in a very similar way to Targets. They can
have a name, a description, an owner, and can be searched for and
edited. Groups can also be used to synchronise the harvest of multiple
related Targets by attaching a schedule to the Group.

Target Instances inherit their group membership from Targets. When a
Target Instance is submitted to an archive, its Target metadata is
included in the SIP, including all Group information.

.. _terminology-4:

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

Important terms used with the Web Curator Tool include:

-  **group** - a set of targets (or other groups) that are related in
   some way.

-  **member** - a group member is a target or group that belongs to the
   group.

-  **expired** - a group is said to have expired when its end date has
   passed.

.. _target-status-1:

Target status 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each group has a status that is automatically calculated by the system:

-  **schedulable** - at least one of its members are approved, and
   therefore a schedule can be attached to this group.

-  **unschedulable** - no members of the group are approved, and
   therefore no schedule can be attached to this group.


Group search page
-----------------

You manage Groups from the **Group search page**:

|image61|

Figure 31. Group search page

At the top of the page are fields to search for existing groups by
**ID**, **Name**, **Agency**, **Owner**, **Member Of**, and **Group
Type**.

**Non-Display Only** allows users to see Groups which have been flagged
as hidden.

    *The search page remembers your last search and repeats it as the
    default search, initially defaulting to search based on your Agency
    only.*

The search results are listed at the bottom of the page. For each, you
may have these options, depending on its state and your permissions:

|view| - **View** the Group

|Edit| - **Edit** the Group

|copy| - **Copy** the Group and create a new one

|delete| - **Delete** the Group

How to create a group
---------------------

From the `Groups <#group-search-page>`__ page,

1. Click **create new**.

   *The* **Create/Edit Groups** *page displays.*

   |image62|

   Figure 32. Create/Edit Groups

The **Create/Edit Groups** page includes several tabs for adding or
editing information about Groups:

-  **General** - general information about the Group, such as a name,
   description, owner, and type

-  **Members** - Targets and Groups which are members of this Group

-  **Member Of** - Groups which this Group is a member of

-  **Profile** - technical instructions on how to harvest the Group

-  **Schedule** - dates and times to perform the harvest

-  **Annotations** - notes about the Group

-  **Description** - metadata about the Group

-  **Access** - settings regarding access to the harvested Group

Groups may have a start and end date. This can be used to define groups
that are based on events, such as elections. This is particularly
relevant to Target Instances, as some harvests of a given Target might
belong to a group, while others may not, depending upon the date of the
harvest and the interval of the Group.

    *When a start or end date is set, members are only considered part of the
    Group during that interval. Once the end date has passed, members are
    not considered to belong to the Group.*

.. _enter-general-information-about-the-target-1:

Enter general information about the target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2. On the **General** tab, enter basic information about the Group.

3. If the 'Sub-Group' type is selected in the 'Type' field, a 'Parent
   Group' field is displayed above the 'Name' field requiring selection

How to edit or view a Group
---------------------------

Editing an existing group is very similar to the process for creating a
new record.

To start editing, go to the Group search page, and click the

|Edit|- **Edit** details

icon from the Actions column. This will load the relevant Group editor.
Note that some users will not have access to edit some (or any) Groups.

An alternative to editing a Group is to click the

|view| - **View** details

icon to open the Group viewer. Groups cannot be changed from within the
viewer. Once in the Group viewer you may also switch to the editor using
the 'Edit' button

Harvesting a group
------------------

Groups can also be used to synchronise the harvest of multiple related
Targets by attaching a schedule to a Group.

Group harvests can be performed in two different ways:

-  **Multiple SIP** - Each of the Targets in the Group have multiple
   Target Instances scheduled with the same harvest start date.

-  **Single SIP** - The seed URLs from all the Targets in the Group are
   combined into a single Target Instance, and are harvested in one
   operation, quality reviewed in one operation, and submitted to the
   archive in one operation.

Single SIP harvests are performed using the profile settings and profile
override settings for the Group (not the individual Targets).

The In Tray
=====================

.. _introduction-6:

Introduction
------------

The **In Tray** is a place where the Web Curator Tool sends you notices
and tracks any tasks that have been assigned to you.

The display below shows the *Tasks* and *Notifications* specific to your
login. These can also (at your option) be emailed to you.

|image68|

Figure 37. In Tray

    *Note that the* **In Tray** *- and each Web Curator Tool page - has
    tabs across the top to access the main system functions, which
    match the icons on the Home Page.*

Tasks
-----

*Tasks* are events that require action from you (or from someone else
with your privileges).

They support workflows where different people are involved at different
steps in the harvesting process. For example, the person creating a
Target may not be the same as the person who endorses a Target.

For each Task, you can:

|view| - **View** details of the task

|delete| - **Delete** the task

|claim| - **Claim** the task (for example, if you are among those who can endorse a harvest, you can claim the task so that you can then perform the endorsement).

|action-icon-unclaim| - **Un-claim** the task (for example, if you have accidentally claimed a task that is more appropriately carried out by someone else then you can release the task back to the pool of un-claimed tasks for someone else to claim).

Tasks are automatically created, and get automatically deleted once they
have been finished (and will then disappear from the In Tray).

There is an option to 'Delete All' if the Tasks list is getting long,
but this should only be used if no one in the agency is using the Tasks
functionality as part of their workflow, otherwise use the option 'Click
to hide' instead.

The different types of Task are outlined below.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| **Type**              | **Reason**            | **Recipient**         |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

|                       | for a permission      | privilege.            |
|                       | record.               |                       |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Endorse Target        | A Target Instance     | Users with the        |
|                       | needs to be endorsed  | Endorse privilege.    |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Archive Target        | A Target Instance     | Users with the        |
|                       | needs to be archived  | Archive privilege.    |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

|                       | nominated and needs   | Approve Target        |
|                       | to be approved.       | privilege.            |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Notifications
-------------

*Notifications* are messages generated by the system to tell you about
the state of your data. Administrators may also receive notifications
about the state of the harvesters.

For each Notification, you can:

|view| - **View** details of the notification

|delete| - **Delete** the notification

The different types of notification are outlined below.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| **Type**              | **Trigger**           | **Recipient**         |

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Most notifications are sent only to people within the same Agency. The
exception is the system usage warnings that are sent to all users with
Manage Web Harvester privilege.

Receive Tasks and Notifications via Email
-----------------------------------------

In your user settings page, the "Receive task notifications by email"
setting controls whether notifications and tasks in your In Tray are
also emailed to you.

This is useful if, for example, you want to receive an email
notification when a harvest finishes.

User, Roles, Agencies, Rejection Reasons & QA Indicators
====================================================================

.. _introduction-7:

Introduction
------------

The Web Curator Tool has a flexible system of users, permissions, roles
and agencies. Each user belongs to an agency, and has a number of roles
that define the access individual users have to Web Curator Tool
functionality.

In this chapter we refer to administrative users, who are those users
that can register other users, manage user accounts, assign roles to
users, and adjust the system's configuration. However, in the Web
Curator Tool, an administrative user is simply a user who has been
assigned a role like "System Administrator" or "Agency Administrator",
and the exact responsibilities of these roles (and even their names)
will likely vary between institutions.

Users
-----

Each user has a Web Curator Tool account, which includes some basic
identifying information and some preferences.

Each user is also assigned one or more roles. Roles are sets of Web
Curator Tool privileges that restrict the access individual users have
to Web Curator Tool functionality.

Roles
-----

A role is a way of capturing a set of privileges and responsibilities
that can be assigned to sets of Web Curator Tool Users. Each role has a
set of privileges attached. Users who are assigned the role will be
given permission to perform operations.

Most privileges can be adjusted to three levels of scope: **All**,
**Agency**, or **Owner**. If the scope of an active permission is set to
**All** then the permission applies to all objects; if it is set to
**Agency** then it applies only to those objects that belong to the same
agency as the user; if it is set to **Owner** it applies only to those
owned by that user.

Agencies
--------

An agency is an organisation who is involved in harvesting websites
using the tool. Users and roles are defined for an agency scope and
Targets, Groups and Harvest Authorisations are also owned at Agency
level. This provides a convenient way of managing access to the tool for
multiple organisations.

Harvest authorisation privileges
--------------------------------

The permissions that control access to the harvest authorisation module
are listed in the Role editing page in the **Manage Copying Permissions
and Access Rights** section.

They are:

-  Create Harvest Authorisations

-  Modify Harvest Authorisations

-  Confirm Permissions

-  Modify Permissions

-  Transfer Linked Targets

-  Enable/Disable Harvest Authorisations

-  Generate Permission Requests

Target privileges
-----------------

The permissions that control access to the Target module are listed in
the Role editing page in the **Manage Targets** section.

They are:

-  Create Target - The user can create new Targets.

-  Modify Target - The user can modify existing Targets.

-  Approve Target - The user can Approve a Target.

-  Cancel Target - The user can Cancel a Target.

-  Delete Target - The user can Delete a Target (but only if that Target
   has no associated Target Instances).

-  Reinstate Target - The user can reinstate a Target that is in the
   Cancelled or Completed state.

-  Add Schedule to Target - The user can attaché a schedule to a Target.

-  Set Harvest Profile Level 1 - The user can attach a profile to the
   Target from among the level 1 profiles.

-  Set Harvest Profile Level 2 - The user can attach a profile to the
   Target from among the level 1 and level 2 profiles.

-  Set Harvest Profile Level 3 - The user can attach a profile to the
   Target from among all the profiles.

   Other privileges within the Roles include the ability to manage
   Rejection Reasons, QA indicators and Flags. This is more of an
   administrative role.

Rejection Reasons
-----------------

When a target or a target instance is rejected there needs to be a
reason for it. E.g. you might want to reject a target for curatorial
reasons or you might actually want to select a target for curatorial
reasons, but cannot do so for technical reasons and therefore you reject
it for technical reasons.

If you have an external report writer it's possible to run a report for
targets that have been rejected for a specific reason.

|image73|

Figure 39. Rejection Reasons

QA Indicators
-------------

The QA indicators are designed to assist a user to determine whether a
harvested TI requires quality review or can be archived/delisted based
on a number of indicators. Recommendations are viewed in the Target
Instance Summary for a TI once the TI has been harvested.

The indicators below have been pre-populated by a template that can be
installed when WCT is set up.

|image74|

Figure 40. QA Indicators

Flags
-----

Flags provide the ability to highlight a target instance so that action
can be taken. They are set within an agency so all the users of that
agency share the same flags. E.g. an agency might want to flag TI's that
have harvesting issues so that an analyst can investigate them.

|image75|

Figure 41. Flags

Reports
===================

.. _introduction-8:

Introduction
------------

The Reports screen gives users access to several types of report.

System usage report
-------------------

The System Usage Report is a report based on the audit records that
lists the usage sessions for a user (or group of users) over a selected
period.

The criteria for the report are:

-  Start Date;

-  End Date;

-  Agency (optional).

The report will take data from the audit log table and logon duration
tables in the database. Note that the logon times displayed are
estimates and may not be completely accurate.

System activity report
----------------------

The System Activity Report is a report based on the audit records. The
criteria for the report are:

-  Start Date;

-  End Date;

-  Agency (optional);

-  User (optional).

This report will directly take information out of the audit log table in
the database. The following information extracted from the audit log:

-  User ID

-  Username

-  User Real Name (First name plus surname)

-  Activity type

-  Subject Identifier number

-  Message text, which gives an English description of the action.

Crawler activity report
-----------------------

The crawler activity report allows administrators to get a summary of
all the crawling activity undertaken by the Web Curator Tool for a
specified period.

The report has the following parameters:

-  **Start date**: a date and time (to the nearest second)

-  **End date**: a date and time (to the nearest second)

-  **Agency** (optional).

-  **User** (optional);

The report finds all Target Instances where:

-  The State is other than "Scheduled" or "Queued" (i.e. they have been
   sent to a crawler), and

-  The period when the crawl was running overlaps the interval defined
   by the start date and end-date parameters.

The output includes the following fields: Identifier, Target Name,
status, start date, end date (if known), crawl duration, bytes
downloaded, harvest agent.

Target/Group Schedules report
-----------------------------

The Target/Group Schedules report is a report showing the harvest
schedules for \`Approved' Targets and/or Groups.

The report has the following filter parameters:

-  Agency (optional)

-  User (optional)

-  Target Type (optional)

The report details the schedules of all Targets and/or Groups where:

-  The State is "Approved" (for Targets) or "Active" (for Groups).

The output includes the following fields: Target/Group ID, Type (Target
or Group), Name, Agency, Owner, From Date, To Date (if known) and
Schedule Type followed by schedule type specific details.

Summary Target Schedules report
-------------------------------

The Summary Target Schedules report is a summary report of the harvest
schedules for 'Approved' Targets and/or Groups.

The report has the following filter parameters:

-  Agency (optional)

The report details the numbers of schedules of particular types for all
Targets and/or Groups where:

-  The State is "Approved" (for Targets) or "Active" (for Groups).

The output includes the counts of all known schedule types for the
selected agency or all agencies.

Harvester Configuration
===================================

Introduction
------------

The **Harvester Configuration** can be found in the General tab of the
Management section. It enables the user to view the current status of
the harvesters and allows a certain level of control over the harvesting
schedule.

|image78|

Figure 42. Harvester Configuration

If you click on the name of the harvester you can see which jobs are
currently running. The numbers under **Job** refers to the target
instance that is currently running.

|image79|

Figure 43. Shows the number of jobs running on a particular harvester

Bandwidth limits
----------------

Bandwidth limits must be created before any harvesting can be
undertaken. The default setting is '0'. Bandwidth will be allocated to a
harvest as a percentage of the allowed bandwidth for the period.

In figure 36 the bandwidth has been set to run at a reduced rate during
the day and run at a higher level in the evenings and weekends.

|image80|

Figure 44. Bandwidth limits, harvest optimisation and heatmap

In figure 44 above if you click on the hyperlinked numbers you can
choose to optimise your harvests at particular times of the day or week
earlier than the schedule otherwise permits. The window for this
look-ahead is configurable and defaults to 12 hours. This example shows
that optimisation has been set for evenings and weekends.

You will also need to check the 'harvest optimization' button on the
target schedule. If you need to run a harvest at a specified time then
simply leave the 'harvest optimization' button on the target record
unchecked.

If you need to disable this feature temporarily you can do so from the
Harvester Configuration general screen. Simply click on Optimize
scheduled jobs button to disable and then click again when you want to
enable the functionality again.

The heatmap threshold can be changed to suit what you consider to be
your low, medium or high harvesting levels.

Profiles
--------

The WCT profile contains settings that control how a harvest behaves.
The settings for WCT profiles are based on Heritrix profiles. Profiles
can be created to crawl particular kinds of websites, such as blogs.

You manage profiles from the Profiles search page:

|image81|

Figure 45. Profile search page

You can import a profile from an existing XML file. Once a profile is
imported you will need to rename it, otherwise it will be called
'Profile Imported on…'

Or you can **create new** profiles

There are actions, with options to:

|action-icon-view| - **View** the profile

|click here to EDIT this item| - **Edit** the profile

|click here to COPY this item| - **Copy** the profile and create a new
one

|click here to Export this item as XML| - **Export** a copy of the
profile

|click here to Transfer this profiles targets| - **Transfer** targets
associated with one profile to another profile

|delete| - **Delete** profile. Profiles can only be deleted if they have no target
instances associated with the profile.

How to create a profile
-----------------------

From the **Profile** page

1. Select the harvester type (Heritrix 3, Heritrix 1)

2. Click **create new**

3. The **Create/Edit profile** page displays


The **Create/Edit profile** page includes several tabs for adding or
editing information about profiles.

**Heritrix 3**:

   |image96|

   Figure 46. Profile page

   - **General** - general information about the profile, such as a name,
     description, agency, whether it's an active or inactive profile and what
     level the profile should be set.

   - **Scope** - settings that decide the general crawl parameters. This
     is a simplified set of availble Heritrix 3 settings.

    +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | **Parameter**         | **Description**                   |
    +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | Contact URL           | A contact URL for the person or   |
    |                       | entity running the crawl.         |
    +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | User Agent Prefix     | The first piece of text that      |
    |                       | comprises the final User Agent    |
    |                       | string that Heritrix 3 will use.  |
    |                       | Be sure to replace the            |
    |                       | *@VERSION@* text with the         |
    |                       | Heritrix version you are using.   |
    +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | Document Limit        | The maximum number of documents to|
    |                       | harvest during the crawl. Once the|
    |                       | document count has exceeded this  |
    |                       | limit, Heritrix will stop the     |
    |                       | crawl. A value of zero means no   |
    |                       | upper limit.                      |
    +-----------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | Data Limit            | The maximum file size to write to |

   Figure 46. Profile page

   - **General** - general information about the profile, such as a name,
     description, agency, whether it's an active or inactive profile and what
     level the profile should be set.

   - **Base** - Information about the crawl order, user-agent string, and
     robots honouring policy.

   - **Scope** - settings that decide for each discovered URI if it's within
     the scope of the current crawl. Several scopes are provided with
     Heritrix such as DecidingScope, PathScope and HostScope

   - **Frontier** - this maintains the internal state of the crawl. It
     effects the order in which the URIs are crawled

   The remaining tabs **Pre-fetchers**, **Fetchers**, **Extractors**,
   **Writers**, and **Post-Processors** are a series of processors that a
   URI passes through when it is crawled.

Permission Request Templates
=======================================

Introduction
------------

The **Permission Request Templates** can be found in the Management
section. It enables the user with the appropriate role to open an
existing permission template, or add a new one to the list.

You can choose whether to use a generic template with information that
can be attached to any harvest authorisation or set up a new one each
time if specific information is required.

|image89|

Figure 47. Permission request templates

Some agencies prefer to handle Permission requests outside of WCT and
simply add the file number to the Harvest Authorisation once permission
is granted.

HTML Serials
========================

Introduction
------------

Online serials in HTML format can harvested using WCT and archived as
individual issues.

The National Library of New Zealand introduced this functionality when
they discovered serials that were previously issued as PDFs were being
issued online solely in HTML format. HTML serials functionality is
closely tied in with using the Rosetta preservation system however, [2]_
so if you want to use this option and you're not using Rosetta, you will
need to investigate alternative delivery options that allow you to view
serials by issue date rather than harvest date.

HTML Serials can be set up as a separate agency within WCT. A user can
only be a member of one agency, so it works best if one team does HTML
serial harvesting while another team does web harvesting. If users do
both then they will need to login with a different username and password
for one of the agencies.

The workflow is similar to the web harvesting workflow. The target
record is created for the serial. The seed URL is likely to change with
each new issue. Because of this it is standard practice to use 'harvest
now' rather than create ongoing schedules.

The HTML serials standard profile using Heritrix 1 is a pathscope profile.

The new QA Indicators are designed for websites so it's best to use the
log files and tree view to quality review the harvested serial issue.

Once the serial issue has been harvested and is ready for archiving you
can endorse the harvest. If you don't use Rosetta you can simply archive
the serial. If you do use Rosetta you will see a 'next' button pop up
(see figure 48 below). The National Library uses this metadata form to
link the HTML serial with the producer record in the preservation system
as well as add the issue number and issue date.

In Rosetta it's necessary to distinguish the HTML serials ingest from
the web harvesting workflow so that the appropriate viewer is used. To
do this the Target record description tab has eSerial set as a default
in the HTML serials agency. The viewer in the archive will then display
the serial by issue number and date.

Workflow
===================

Minimal workflow
----------------

The basic workflow for harvesting a website with the Web Creator Tool
is:

1. Obtain **Harvest Authorization** for the harvest and record it in a
   permission record.

2. Create a **Target** that defines the web material you want to
   harvest, technical harvest parameters and schedules for harvesting.

3. **Approve** the Target.

4. *The Web Curator Tool will create* **Target Instances** *according
   to your schedule, run the harvests for you, and notify you that the
   Target Instance is in the* **Harvested** *state and ready for
   review.*

5. **Quality Review** the Target Instance, then **endorse** the results.

6. Submit the harvest to a digital archive.

These steps do not always have to be performed in order, though there
are some constraints on how the tasks can be performed, as outlined
below.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Step**                          | **Prerequisites**                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1. Obtain Harvest Authorization   |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2. Create a Target                |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3. Approve the Target             | Harvest authorisation created,    |
|                                   | Seed URLs linked to permission    |
|                                   | records.                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4. Run harvests                   | Seed URLs linked to permission    |
|                                   | records that have been granted.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5. Quality review and endorse     | Harvest has been run.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 6. Submit to archive              | Harvest result is endorsed.       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Targets, and harvests in an institution that requires users to seek
permission before initiating any harvests:
