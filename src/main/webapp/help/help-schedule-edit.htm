 Cron expressions are comprised of 6 required fields and one optional field
 separated by white space. The fields respectively are described as follows:

 The '*' character is used to specify all values. For example, &quot;*&quot; 
 in the minute field means &quot;every minute&quot;.
 <P/>
 The '?' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. It
 is used to specify 'no specific value'. This is useful when you need to
 specify something in one of the two fileds, but not the other.
 <P/>
 The '-' character is used to specify ranges For example &quot;10-12&quot; in
 the hour field means &quot;the hours 10, 11 and 12&quot;.
 <P/>
 The ',' character is used to specify additional values. For example
 &quot;MON,WED,FRI&quot; in the day-of-week field means &quot;the days Monday,
 Wednesday, and Friday&quot;.
 <P/>
 The '/' character is used to specify increments. For example &quot;0/15&quot;
 in the seconds field means &quot;the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45&quot;. And 
 &quot;5/15&quot; in the seconds field means &quot;the seconds 5, 20, 35, and
 50&quot;.  Specifying '*' before the  '/' is equivalent to specifying 0 is
 the value to start with. Essentially, for each field in the expression, there
 is a set of numbers that can be turned on or off. For seconds and minutes, 
 the numbers range from 0 to 59. For hours 0 to 23, for days of the month 0 to
 31, and for months 1 to 12. The &quot;/&quot; character simply helps you turn
 on every &quot;nth&quot; value in the given set. Thus &quot;7/6&quot; in the
 month field only turns on month &quot;7&quot;, it does NOT mean every 6th 
 month, please note that subtlety.  
 <P/>
 The 'L' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields.
 This character is short-hand for &quot;last&quot;, but it has different 
 meaning in each of the two fields. For example, the value &quot;L&quot; in 
 the day-of-month field means &quot;the last day of the month&quot; - day 31 
 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the 
 day-of-week field by itself, it simply means &quot;7&quot; or 
 &quot;SAT&quot;. But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it
 means &quot;the last xxx day of the month&quot; - for example &quot;6L&quot;
 means &quot;the last friday of the month&quot;. When using the 'L' option, it
 is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get 
 confusing results.
 <P/>
 The 'W' character is allowed for the day-of-month field.  This character 
 is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day.  As an 
 example, if you were to specify &quot;15W&quot; as the value for the 
 day-of-month field, the meaning is: &quot;the nearest weekday to the 15th of
 the month&quot;. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on 
 Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the
 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. 
 However if you specify &quot;1W&quot; as the value for day-of-month, and the
 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 
 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days.  The 'W' character can only be 
 specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.
 <P/>
 The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined for the day-of-month 
 expression to yield 'LW', which translates to &quot;last weekday of the 
 month&quot;.
 <P/>
 The '#' character is allowed for the day-of-week field. This character is
 used to specify &quot;the nth&quot; XXX day of the month. For example, the 
 value of &quot;6#3&quot; in the day-of-week field means the third Friday of 
 the month (day 6 = Friday and &quot;#3&quot; = the 3rd one in the month). 
 Other examples: &quot;2#1&quot; = the first Monday of the month and 
 &quot;4#5&quot; = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify
 &quot;#5&quot; and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then
 no firing will occur that month.
 <P/>
 <P/>
 The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week must be entered in upper case.
 
 <p>
 <b>NOTES:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Support for specifying both a day-of-week and a day-of-month value is
 not complete (you'll need to use the '?' character in on of these fields).
 </li>
 </ul>
